    <h2>
      Preface.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR many years we
      have been of opinion that a work on NESTS and EGGS, in life-like colors,
      would be a valuable acquisition to ornithological science, and meet a want
      that has long been felt to exist. After vainly hoping that some more
      competent person than the writer would see the necessity therefor, and
      take a step in the right direction, we were beginning to despair of any
      such enterprise being undertaken, when, to our surprise, two publications,
      partially of this character, loomed up in the literary horizon, one
      hailing from Ohio, and the other from New England; the former, a local
      publication, seemed of such high pecuniary value as to be beyond the
      public reach; while the latter, fully up to it in merit of learning, but
      illustrating merely the eggs, was destined to failure from the first, and,
      after running a brief career, has at last ceased to exist. Under these
      circumstances we embarked in the project, in the confident expectation
      that our ornithological friends and others would give us encouraging
      support.
    </p>
    <p>
      The utter impracticability and, we may say, impossibility of any scheme
      looking to the delineations of all the nests built by the many hundred
      birds belonging to our country, in the small space of a single volume, was
      obvious at the outset. All that we could promise our conscience were the
      figures of representative forms, and this we have kept in view, and
      endeavored to fulfil. To future series, if there should be a demand, we
      will leave the continuation of the subject, when, not being necessarily
      restricted to family types, we shall labor to invest the Plates with
      greater charms and attractiveness in the shape of rarer and more
      magnificent birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon cursory examination it will readily be perceived that the work has
      considerably deviated from its original aim. This change occurred shortly
      after the issuance of the third number, and in obedience to the popular
      demand, which insisted that the birds should be given with the nests,
      thereby entailing increased expense, but adding, it cannot be denied,
      largely to the beauty, utility and value of the publication. This
      innovation, dictated by good sense and sound knowledge, necessitated
      further expenditures of capital. In order that an air of uniformity should
      pervade the entire work, it was very essential that extra plates of birds
      should be furnished for the early drawings of nests. Determined that the
      work should be first class in every respect, and well worthy of patronage,
      the publisher spared not the expense, and once more exceeded the promises
      made to his patrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Especial pains have been taken with the text. The aim of the author has
      been to present a short, plain and detailed account of the habits of each
      species described, from the time of its arrival, if a migrant, until its
      retirement to the South in the fall. In the case of resident birds, he has
      been particular to give their winter history in addition to that of the
      breeding season, in the same orderly and continuous manner as is apparent
      in his descriptions of their more migratory brethren. The presentation of
      the events in regular sequence, if great care be not taken, is sure to
      lead to monotony. This he has tried to avoid, but how well he has
      succeeded, he defers to the judgment of his readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the work, considerable prominence has been given to those
      interesting and curious phases of bird-life which are present during the
      breeding-period, and which have been the principal study of the author for
      many years. Extraneous matter has been sedulously omitted, and nothing
      permitted to appear about which there could be serious doubts of accuracy.
      While he has drawn largely and, in very many instances, almost entirely
      from his own observations, recorded and unrecorded, for material, he has
      not hesitated to consult the writings of others, or to avail himself of
      the statements of reliable correspondents, where his own knowledge has
      been incomplete or defective. Wilson, Audubon, Nuttall, Brewer, although
      dead, have spoken to him through their valuable works, and yielded up
      their varied observations for occasional selections. Among living authors,
      to Baird, Coues, Ridgway, Allen, Samuels, Cory and Minot, and others less
      eminent, he has had access through their writings, and he now takes this
      opportunity of returning to them his grateful acknowledgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the arrangement of the details of the Plates, the artist has been
      subject to the suggestions and dictations of the author, the constant aim
      of the latter being to secure accuracy in this respect, as well as the
      greatest variety possible. The typography, for clearness, sharpness,
      regularity and finish, has rarely been surpassed by that of any other
      work. Much praise is due the enterprising publisher for his liberality and
      public-spiritedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these few preliminary remarks, we send this beautiful book out into
      the world, trusting that it may meet with a cordial reception everywhere.
      If it be the means of acquainting man with the lovable manners and
      interesting domestic relations of a few, though not all, of our feathered
      friends, and of restraining our youth from nest-destroying propensities by
      offering them pictures of the homes of birds for study and contemplation,
      and thus abate the evil; or if it add but one new fact to the author's
      favorite science of ornithology, or benefit it in any way whatever, he
      will rest satisfied, and feel that he has not labored in vain.

      Plate I.&mdash;AMPELIS CEDRORUM, Sclater.&mdash;Cedar-Bird.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Cedar-Bird,
      though mainly a denizen of the wooded regions of North America, and
      occasionally of cultivated fields and orchards, has been known to nest
      from Florida to the Red River country. But, wherever found during the
      non-breeding period, it is the same gregarious, nomadic species.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the beginning of October, the search for food so completely
      engrosses the attention, that it is not until the latter part of May, or
      the beginning of June, that the flocks break up into pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nidification now becomes the all-absorbing passion, and the birds after
      mating, which business is generally conducted in a quiet and
      unostentatious manner, repair to the woods or hedges in quest of a
      suitable shrub or tree in which to establish a home. This matter requires
      considerable labor and care; and, ordinarily, no little time is devoted
      thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place usually selected, is a retired and unfrequented thicket or nook;
      or occasionally, an orchard in close proximity to an occupied dwelling.
      When the former, the cedar, with its tall, nearly vertical branches and
      dark green foliage, is, of all our forest-trees, pre-eminently fitted to
      receive, support, and conceal the nest; when the latter, the apple is
      accorded the preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having chosen the locality, the birds waste no time in idleness, but apply
      themselves to the task of building, with the most commendable zeal and
      perseverance. Each bird has its allotted part of the work to perform: the
      duty of the male being to collect the materials; that of the female, to
      shape and fix them in their proper places. Occasionally the latter, when
      not thus occupied, accompanies her partner in his frequent journeys, and
      assists in collecting and bringing in his load. The time employed in the
      labor of construction, making due allowances for recreation and rest, is
      between five and six days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In form, the typical structure is nearly hemispherical, and presents a
      rather neat and elegant appearance. It is compactly made, and, in the
      generality of instances, exhibits anything but bulkiness. In position, it
      rests upon the horizontal limb of a tree, or is wedged in among several
      upward-growing branchlets, at elevations varying from three to twenty
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the period of nidification, almost any substance, having the
      requisite flexibility and strength, is in demand; consequently, the
      materials of composition are as varied as they are numerous, and depend in
      a great measure upon the <i>environment</i>. In thickets, small twigs,
      stems of grasses, dried leaves, lichens, and the tendrils of the vine,
      make up the bulk of the structure; but in places situated in close
      proximity to houses, wrapping-twine, strips of rags, and such other
      substances as are ready prepared and accessible, are utilized. The lining
      is generally fine roots of grasses, bits of string, flower-stalks, lichens
      and tendrils. The cavity seldom exceeds three inches in width, and
      scarcely two and a half in depth; while the external diameter varies from
      four and a half inches to five; and the height, from two and a half to
      three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specimen which we have figured, and which may be regarded as typical
      in its character, was obtained in the vicinity of Bridgeton, N. J., in the
      summer of 1878, and was neatly erected upon the horizontal branch of an
      oak, and held in position by two nearly vertical branches of the same
      tree. It was placed at a height of nearly twenty feet above the ground,
      and consists almost exclusively of fibres of the long greenish-yellow
      lichens which constitute so conspicuous a feature of the trees of that
      locality, in their sylvan retreats. Externally, besides a few fine
      rootlets, there is noticeable much white wrapping-string, which relieves,
      in a great degree, the monotony of the fabric. Internally, there is the
      same green moss-like lichen. The cavity is beautifully symmetrical, and
      measures about three inches in width, and nearly two inches in depth. The
      external diameter is five inches, and the height, two inches. The nest is
      most elaborately finished, and is evidently the workmanship of superior
      mechanics. The Plate represents it three-fourths the natural size, placed
      upon an apple branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other fabrics which the writer possesses, is one which was obtained
      in June, 1871, in Germantown, Pa., saddled upon the horizontal branch of
      an apple-tree. It is rather firmly and compactly built, and is composed,
      exteriorly, of stems of the common timothy, fine rootlets, dried leaves of
      the mullein, and green leaves of the apple, which are held together by
      broad strips of colored rags, bits of lint, and divers strings, the latter
      constituting a prominent feature. Interiorly, there is a promiscuous
      lining of flower-bearing stems, fragments of strings, fine roots of
      grasses, fibres of linen, and tendrils of some species of cucurbitaceous
      plant. The nest is about four and a half inches in external diameter, and
      nearly three in height. The cavity is three inches wide, and two and a
      half inches deep in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last model of architecture, as already remarked, was placed upon the
      limb of an apple-tree, near its extremity, and barely at a distance of
      fifteen paces from an occupied dwelling. The rags, etc., which form such a
      prominent feature of the outside, were purposely furnished by an inmate of
      the house. When first proffered, it was thought that the birds would be
      slow to perceive the use to which they could be put, but not so, for they
      entered into the idea with the most praiseworthy alacrity. And even after
      the materials were no longer supplied, they would repeatedly fly to the
      bush upon which they had been laid, as though soliciting a continuance of
      such favors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The birds having constructed their home, the female commences on the day
      following its completion to deposit her complement of eggs. The time thus
      spent varies from four to six days, and depends upon the number which is
      to constitute a setting. Oviposition being accomplished, incubation
      follows, sometimes immediately on the deposit of the last egg, but, not
      generally, until the succeeding day. This is the exclusive task of the
      female for nearly fourteen consecutive days. Although the male does not
      assist in the labor, yet he shows himself to be a very kind and attentive
      husband, by providing food for his partner, and keeping a vigilant lookout
      for approaching enemies. This he signals by a low single note, which the
      female quickly acknowledges, and instantly the two timid creatures beat a
      hasty retreat to an adjoining tree or shrub beyond the reach of peril,
      where they become passive spectators of the demolishment of their home,
      with all its precious burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs, which are from four to six in number, resemble those of the
      Waxwing, but differ in size, being somewhat smaller. Their groundcolor
      passes from a light slate to a dark stone-color. The markings are chiefly
      blotches of dark purplish-brown, lighter shades of the same color, and
      peuumbræ of light purple, either by themselves, or surrounding the darker
      spots. In form, they are either oblong-oval, or nearly spherical; and in
      length, they vary from .80 to .90 of an inch, and in breadth, from .50 to
      .70 of an inch.

      Plate II.&mdash;CONTOPUS VIRENS, Cabanis.&mdash;Wood Pewee.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Wood Pewee,
      like most of its congeners, has a somewhat extended habitat, ranging from
      the Atlantic westward to the Plains, and from Texas to New Brunswick. It
      visits the United States about the 15th of April, and from this time until
      its departure for Guatemala in October, it is principally an occupant of
      high-wooded regions with a scanty growth of underbrush, and timbered
      river-bottoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the season advances, and the amatory feelings become awakened,
      these shady retreats are deserted by a few individuals of more venturesome
      disposition, and a temporary abiding-place is sought for amid the stirring
      scenes of active farm-life. This generally occurs during the last of May
      or the beginning of June, and is the prelude to the more important act of
      mating, which follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assumption of matrimonial relations, however, is not a matter that is
      entered into without more or less consideration. Occasionally, much time
      is spent in its preparation. This is presumably the case when a young
      female is courted by some venerable male. But when an apparently
      experienced individual is the object of his devotion, the state of things
      is different. His advances are then either encouraged and reciprocated, or
      they are declined, and the disappointed suitor compelled to seek a partner
      elsewhere. It is probable, moreover, that the same birds pair together on
      each return of the breeding-season, unless prevented by death, or some
      other of the numerous vicissitudes of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony of mating being over&mdash;which business is ordinarily of
      short continuance, seldom lasting for a greater period than two days&mdash;the
      newly-wedded pair now set out to discover a suitable place for the
      building of a home. This is a matter of considerable moment, often
      requiring the performance of long and extended tours of observation and
      exploration. These reconnoissances generally last for a week, but
      eventually result in the choice of a locality well adapted, as far as the
      essential conditions of shelter and security are concerned, to become the
      depository of a nest. The site generally chosen for this important purpose
      is a tall open woods with a preponderance of ash or oak trees; but where a
      time-honored orchard is the recipient of this favor, which is sometimes
      the case, the apple, 011 account of the many advantages which it
      possesses, is preferred above all other fruit-trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site being mutually agreed upon, the happy pair proceed with all
      possible dispatch and diligence to construct a domicile: the male to
      collect and bring in the necessary materials; the female, to fix them in
      their proper places, and also to give shape and symmetry to the structure.
      The time devoted to this work varies with the industry of the builders,
      the style of the nest, and the character of the neighborhood. But, where
      the birds are laboring under the most favorable circumstances, the task is
      easily accomplished in five days.
    </p>
    <p>
      This admirable piece of bird-architecture, which rivals in beauty and
      symmetry the nest of our little Ruby-throated Humming-bird, is either
      saddled upon a living or dead limb that is horizontal and lichen-clad, or
      else upon the crotch of a bifurcated branch, and is placed above the
      ground at elevations varying from five to thirty feet. According to Nutt
      all, "the body of the fabric" occasionally consists of "wiry grass or root
      fibres;" but we have yet to meet with a nest with "<i>small branching
      lichens</i> held together with cobwebs and caterpillars' silk, moistened
      with saliva," as that author remarks. In a structure before us, which is
      typical in its character, small strips of inner bark plucked from trees of
      chestnut and oak, bits of tow, and fragments of wool, circularly arranged
      and compactly pi-essed together, are the prevailing constituents.
      Externally, it is closely invested with the bluish-gray crustaceous
      lichens which are so plentiful upon the trunks of certain trees, and also
      upon fence-rails. In diameter, it measures three and a half inches; in
      height, one and a half inches. The width of the cavity is about two
      inches; the depth in the centre, three-fourths of an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most beautiful fabric, as well as the most compactly built, which we
      have seen, was obtained in the spring of 1870, not far from Germantown,
      Pa. It was placed upon a horizontal branch of an apple-tree, in close
      proximity to a farm-house. Externally, it is thickly covered with <i>bluish-gray
      crustaceous lichens</i>, which are held in place by a few cobwebs, and
      fragments of the silk of caterpillars. The base consists of dried stems of
      grasses, and on these is reared a neat and cosy superstructure composed of
      the inner fibres of the wild and cultivated species of the vine, and a
      slight sprinkling of wool. These materials are variously interwoven, and
      arranged around the margin so as to form a cavity. The dimensions of this
      nest are as follows: External diameter, three and a half inches; height,
      one and a half inches; width of cavity, two inches; depth in the centre,
      three-fourths of an inch. In the Plate it is represented the natural size&mdash;built
      upon an oak branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the details of form and dimensions, this nest differs immaterially from
      specimens which we have met with and seen from other localities. But
      wherever obtained, they will always be found to bear a very close
      resemblance to one another, differing chiefly in the character of the
      articles which constitute the inner arrangement. We will merely mention
      one example which was taken by Mr. Welch, in Lynn, Mass., and which will
      give our readers some faint conception of the extent to which variation is
      often carried. This structure was placed upon a dead limb of a
      forest-tree. Its walls were composed of small dry stems and vegetable
      down, finely interwoven, and covered on the outside with lichens which
      were cemented to it by a viscid secretion that was apparently supplied by
      the builders. The base wras somewhat flattened, much thinner than the
      walls, and composed of finer materials. The external diameter was three
      inches, and the height one and a half inches; the cavity, two and a half
      inches at the rim, and the central depth about one inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished their home, only a day or so intervenes when oviposition
      becomes the controlling instinct. The female now proceeds to deposit her
      complement of four eggs, which she does on consecutive days, at the rate
      of a single egg daily. This is followed, on the day succeeding the last
      deposit, by the trying duty of incubation. Upon the female devolves this
      arduous and irksome labor. For about eleven days she is thus engaged,
      until her patience is finally crowned with success. Although the male
      takes no part in this duty, yet he contributes his share to the prosperity
      of the undertaking, by guarding his partner from danger, and supplying her
      with the essential articles of food. When his home is assailed by
      feathered enemies, if they are not more than a match for his strength, he
      is not slow to wreak instant vengeance upon them. But in the case of human
      depredators, where effort would be futile, no exertion is put forth to
      cause desistance from any contemplated assault, save a little scolding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are four in number, and resemble in configuration those of the
      common Phoebe-Bird. They are obtuse at one extremity, and slightly
      tapering at the other. The ground is a rich cream-color, and is
      diversified about the larger end with a wreath of purple and lilac spots,
      which are large, and occasionally confluent. In length, they measure .76
      of an inch, and in width .54. It is pretty well established that but a
      single set is deposited by any given pair of birds in a season. Nests with
      eggs, however, have been taken during the last of July, or the beginning
      of August; but whether a second laying or not, we cannot say&mdash;possibly
      the work of birds whose early efforts had been frustrated.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Cat-Bird is one
      of the most common and conspicuous of all our feathered visitants. It
      reaches the United States from its Central American home, on or about the
      10th of April, and thence diffuses itself over the whole country,
      northward as far as the Saskatchewan, and westward to the Rocky Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately upon its arrival, it seeks the shelter of dense woods, or the
      security of waste fields and bramble-ridden hedges. In such situations,
      among the dead leaves that lie scattered upon the ground, it gleans a
      well-earned subsistence. But later, when the leaves begin to appear, and
      with them an abundance of insect-life, these retreats are deserted by a
      few venturesome individuals, and an abiding-place is sought amid the quiet
      scenes of rural gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week or ten days, however, elapse before the sexes are ready to assume
      conjugal relations. Being vigorous feeders, and living in the midst of
      plenty,' they are seemingly all unconscious of the better and nobler
      instincts of their being. But feeding eventually satisfies appetite, and
      conduces to the awakening of the amatory forces from their hitherto
      dormant condition. The males, by their altered demeanor, are the first to
      show signs of change. We no longer observe them engaged in the pursuit of
      the juicy caterpillar, or the gilded butterfly, with the same energy and
      zest as before. Their aims are higher, their aspirations loftier. Perched
      upon a small tree, or screened from observation by dense clumps of bushes,
      with heads bent skyward, they startle the echoes of woodland and valley
      with their strange, ecstatic music. But the females still continue
      feeding, as though utterly oblivious of the concert which is intended for
      their benefit. After a day or two thus spent, they become less absorbed in
      such matters, yield to the potency of song, and coyly emerge from
      obscurity to welcome and encourage their would-be suitors. The period of
      courtship is short, and unattended by any of those peculiar antics which
      characterize many species at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Middle and Western States mating occasionally commences as early as
      the 25th of April, when the season is remarkably forward, but generally
      about the first of May&mdash;seldom later. In the Territories, from some
      unknown cause, it is delayed to a later period. Very little time is wasted
      after this event has occurred, in celebrating the occasion, for the pair
      soon begin to look for a proper nesting-place. This is a labor not entered
      into without previous care and deliberation. Ordinarily a week or ten days
      are spent in making a choice of locality. The site selected is usually a
      brier, cedar, thorn-apple, or a bush in the midst of a grove or hedge,
      seldom remote from a settlement. The nest is sometimes placed in a maple,
      and when such is the case, the birds take the precaution to build it
      pretty well up. During the summer of 1880, my son discovered one in a
      crotch of the red maple, at an elevation of thirty feet from the ground.
      This, however, is exceptional, as the height usually ranges from three to
      about twelve feet. It sometimes happens that an injudicious selection of
      locality has been made, and a nest has been nearly completed before the
      mistake is discovered. In this predicament, instead of "making the best of
      a bad bargain," the birds ignore the site for another better suited to
      their purposes. The situation being finally decided upon, both birds work
      diligently during the cooler hours of the morning and evening, for five or
      six days, in the construction of their home. In some instances,
      particularly during moonlit nights, the work has been carried on long
      after twilight has faded from the earth. Unlike the case of the
      Cedar-Bird, which we have already cited, there does not seem to be any
      regular division of labor. Both birds collect the materials, as well as
      arrange them in the nest. When a suitable article has been found, the
      finder does not fly immediately to the nest and adjust the piece, but
      indulges in short flights from one object to an adjoining one, carefully
      surveying the premises all the while, until within a few yards of the
      nest, when she rapidly flies thither, and having disposed of her burden,
      goes off in quest of others. Where accustomed to man, the Cat-Bird does
      not seem to be much annoyed by his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nidification ordinarily commences about the 18th of May. The nest is
      placed in various positions&mdash;sometimes 011 a horizontal limb,
      occasionally in a crotch, but generally among the branches of the bush
      upon which it reposes. The materials of composition are as varied as they
      are numerous. In thickets, and also in places removed from human
      habitations, a platform of dried leaves, slender sticks, or weeds is used
      as a basis, on which is reared a superstructure of small twigs, fine
      roots, herbaceous plants, bits of straws, pine needles, and other
      materials which are common to such situations. But when a nest is built in
      close proximity to the home of man, bits of string, strands of silk or
      thread, and bunches of cotton or wool are appropriated, and made to do
      excellent service.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the foregoing remarks it is obvious that nests vary according to
      changes in the <i>environment</i>. Hence, what is typical in one locality
      might be deemed but a deviation from the normal form, when compared with a
      nest of the same species found in an entirely different neighborhood, and
      <i>vice versa</i>. Mr. Ingersoll describes a nest found near Norwich,
      Connecticut, which was suspended between two small bushes in such a manner
      that it had no other support than that afforded by a slender spray from
      each bush; but the large mass of crooked sticks below offered so many
      hooked ends and projections that the nest was very secure. The writer
      describes elsewhere a nest that was carelessly made, and bearing a close
      resemblance to the structure of the Maryland Yellow-throat, which he
      supposed to be the work of young or indolent birds. Another, on the
      contrary, showed superior workmanship. The outside of this cosy and
      beautiful nest was composed of wool, raw cotton, strings, fragments of
      lamp-wick, a slight intermixture of tangled silk, fragments of lichens,
      etc., held <i>in situ</i> by strands of silk. Upon this basis was built a
      superstructure of fine rootlets, intermingled with patches of wool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest which we have figured in the Plate was found in the vicinity of
      Philadelphia, Pa., in the summer of 1876. It is represented the usual
      size, and shown in its natural position upon a cluster of blackberry
      branches. Exteriorly, it is formed of wrapping string, bits of thread,
      fine roots, cotton ravelings, a few grayish lichens, and bunches of
      discolored raw cotton in great quantities. Interiorly, there is a lining
      of slender grass stems, which monotony is relieved in a measure by a piece
      of lamp-wick. The external diameter is five inches, and the height about
      two and a half. The cavity is three and a half inches, and the depth an
      inch and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such facts as are detailed above, with innumerable others of a similar
      nature that might be adduced, most abundantly and conclusively prove that
      birds are not the dull, senseless, routine-loving creatures which those
      who have some pre-conceived opinion to uphold, or cherished theory to
      sustain, are wont to argue. Though many of their actions are purely
      instinctive or mechanical, yet evidence is not wanting to show that they
      are gifted with a faculty similar in character to that possessed by man,
      but differing in degree. A thousand circumstances justify the belief that
      they often reason <i>a priori</i> from cause to consequences, providently
      managing with a constant aim for future comfort, convenience and
      necessity. Instinct is always the same thing, never advancing, never
      retrograding. Reason tends to improvement, always seeking a higher plane
      of existence. To say that changes in nest-building imply a <i>change of
      instinct</i>, is to perplex the understanding by a perversion of language;
      but to ascribe them to the operations of reason, influenced by motives,
      seems to be the most rational view to take of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest being completed, which is usually the case in about five days
      from the time of starting, a brief season elapses before any eggs are
      laid. In the Northern States this happens about the third week of May, and
      then only one is deposited each day, for four or five days. The necessary
      complement being laid, the female immediately takes the nest, and
      incubation follows. This is her exclusive task for a period of twelve or
      thirteen days. While she is thus engaged, the male stations himself
      close-by the nest, only departing therefrom in quest of food for himself
      and partner. Should an enemy approach, he assails the intruder with
      commendable fearlessness and boldness. Various snakes, particularly the
      black-snake, are their inveterate foes. When an attack is made by one of
      these wily creatures, both parents, heedless of danger, often fly so close
      to the assailant as to lose their lives in efforts to prevent the nest
      being ravished and despoiled. But in the case of human depredators,
      knowing that resistance would be futile, they seek to deter them from any
      contemplated sacrilege by the most discordant cries and frantic gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are objects of tenderest solicitude. Both parents vie with each
      other in rendering them every needed service. While one is absent from
      home in search of food for their rapacious appetites, the other is
      guarding the nest and its precious charges with the most jealous care.
      Earthworms, spiders, flies, caterpillars of non-irritating properties,
      together with such berries as the season affords, are collected in vast
      quantities, and fed to these helpless creatures. But as they increase in
      size and age, other articles are added to their voluminous bill of fare.
      In about twelve days from the time of hatching, the young are able to quit
      the nest, and in six days more, are ready to be initiated into the
      mysteries of flight. This important duty devolves exclusively upon the
      male parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are oval in form, of a dark emerald green color, very highly
      polished, and measure .97 of an inch in length, and .68 in width. There is
      small chance of confounding this with any other American bird's eggs&mdash;certainly
      after a specimen has been once seen. Dr. Abbott, as quoted by Ernest
      Ingersoll, once discovered a nest, at Trenton, N. J., that contained
      purely white eggs, which hatched in due time into perfect young. Similar
      instances are known in the case of other species laying dark eggs, where
      one or two white examples have been found among others of the normal color
      in the same nest-complement. But a single brood is positively known to be
      raised, although cases have come under our observation of nests with fresh
      eggs as late as the 15th of August&mdash;possibly the work of birds whose
      early efforts had been frustrated by enemies, or by some accident.

      Plate IV.&mdash;ICTERUS SPURIUS, Bonaparte.&mdash;Orchard Oriole.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Orchard Oriole
      is quite abundant throughout most of the United States, from the Atlantic
      to the Missouri Valley, and on the southwest to the valley of the Rio
      Grande. Individuals have been met with by Mr. J. A. Allen as far west as
      the base of the Rocky Mountains, in Colorado, the extreme limit of its
      western range. It is probable that it breeds throughout the entire area of
      its distribution&mdash;sparingly, however, in New England, according to
      eminent authority; but quite freely in the Central States, from New York
      to South Carolina, and thence south-west to Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period of its arrival in the United States from the genial clime of
      Guatemala, where it winters, has been fixed by Mr. Dresser, who has
      carefully studied its nesting-habits in Texas, as early as the first or
      second week of April. But, farther north, its presence is not observed
      before the last week of April, or the beginning of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the Warblers and Thrushes, which prefer secluded localities, the
      subject of our sketch delights in cultivated grounds, particularly where
      the apple and the pear abound. Here it takes up its quarters, accomplishes
      the object of its mission, and thence retires to its distant winter-home.
      Occasionally, a few individuals are to be found in waste grounds, dense
      thickets, or along the borders of woods, but such cases are exceptional,
      and conditioned only by the close proximity of some time-honored orchard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mating does not occur until the 10th of May, more than two weeks after the
      advent of the sexes. But from the first, the male, who precedes his
      partner by some two or three days, may be heard in the early morning, and
      quite as frequently at the close of the day, from the tall tree-tops,
      chanting his wanton rhapsodies, for a half-hour at a time, utterly
      unmindful of passers-by. His roundelay, which is undoubtedly the free and
      happy expression of a heart actuated by the generous impulses of love,
      though composed of rather shrill and sprightly notes, and uttered with
      considerable agitation, is quite as pleasing as that of his nearest kin,
      the Baltimore Oriole. Clear, distinct and resonant, it thrills the air
      around, and is at last borne to the ears of some lonely female, tired with
      travel, and unblest by a partner. The life of the Orchard Oriole seems to
      be one of joyous song. Although, fond of a dainty tid-bit, in the form of
      a juicy worm, he is not given to gormandizing; he only eats from sheer
      necessity; for, after having satisfied the demands of Nature, he resumes
      his soul-stirring strains, to the delight of man and bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sexes having come together in a wise and business-like way, with
      little or none of the bluster that is customary on such occasions, a
      conference ensues, which results in a temporary separation for mutual
      good; one bird going in one direction, and the other in an entirely
      opposite course. The selection of a suitable spot for a home is the <i>vera
      causa</i> of this divergence. This is evidently a labor of little moment,
      as, ordinarily, but a day or two is thus spent. It must not be inferred,
      however, that the birds are not particular as to place. A large experience
      has convinced us that great care and deliberation are then exercised. Many
      a tree is visited, and often the same tree again and again, before a
      decision is reached; and when at last a suitable site has been chosen, the
      happy pair set to work with praiseworthy diligence to construct a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As previously remarked, an apple- or a pear-tree is generally chosen for
      nesting purposes. This is especially the case, as far as we are able to
      ascertain, in the Central and Western States; but in Texas, the nest is
      suspended from the upper branches of a mesquite-tree. In the North, the
      common red maple, and several species of coniferous trees, are
      occasionally chosen, from some peculiar advantages which they possess. A
      nest in the writer's collection, which was built in the summit of a common
      swamp maple, occupies a very anomalous position. It is placed within a
      crotch formed by four nearly upright, slightly divergent branches, and is
      secured by long, flexible grasses from the nest, wrapped tightly around
      the twigs. Another specimen, from Germantown, Pa., is made to dangle from
      the end of a pine-branch. A peculiarity about the latter nest is the
      strained position which the four branches to which it is fastened are made
      to assume. The main twig, which is also the thickest (being about
      three-fourths of an inch in diameter) shows evidence of having been forced
      from a horizontal position to one that is almost vertical. The latter is
      really the best authenticated case we have seen of the truly pensile style
      of nest. In most instances these structures are but partially suspended,
      being supported from beneath by projecting branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five or six days from the time of the assumption of matrimonial
      relations, the nest is started, and through the united efforts of both
      birds for the period of a week, is brought to completion. Although
      nidification usually commences about the 20th of May, from some
      inexplicable cause or other, this essential business is often deferred
      until the middle of June and, occasionally, as late as the beginning of
      August. But in the latter case, the birds are undoubtedly prevented by
      varions accidents from carrying out their designs earlier in the season.
      In the building of a home, either the male collects the materials, and the
      female weaves them into a nest, or the converse is the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is little variety noticeable in the materials that compose the nest.
      The generality of domiciles which we have seen from Texas, Georgia,
      Florida, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and several of the Western States, have
      no lining, but are entirely constituted of one substance&mdash;a flexible
      kind of grass or reed. In a few cases we have discovered a slight lining
      of vegetable wool, doubtless plucked from the young and developing fronds
      of various species of ferns. Bits of yarn, down of seeds, and animal wool,
      have been mentioned by various observers as occasional linings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the homogeneity of its texture, that once seen and recognized, it
      can never be forgotten or confounded. A nest from Texas is the exact
      counterpart of a similar structure from Pennsylvania, or of one from
      Michigan. The abundance of the particular species of grass out of which
      these birds construct their homes, and the facility with which it is
      obtainable in localities remote from each other, conspire to produce the
      resemblances which are found to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plate IV exhibits a nest of this species which was obtained in the
      vicinity of Germantown, Pa., during the summer of 1880. It was suspended
      from the branches of a pear-tree, in the manner shown in the drawing, at
      an elevation of forty feet from the ground. It is built exteriorly of a
      peculiar kind of long, tough and flexible grass, which is common in
      Pennsylvania. The material is woven through and through in a very
      wonderful manner, and with as much neatness and intricacy as if actually
      done by a needle. It is hemispherical in shape, and open at the top. The
      external diameter is four inches, and height two and a half inches; the
      cavity is two and a half inches wide, and two and three-quarters in depth.
      The color of the outside is yellow, while that of the inside is a deep
      brownish-red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another specimen which the writer possesses from the same locality, is
      built of the same material, more highly colored interiorly, but less so
      exteriorly. It is pouch-shaped, and measures two and a half inches in
      internal diameter, and four and a half inches in depth. The length is five
      inches, and the external diameter three inches. When in position, this
      nest was so placed that the short spurs of the pear upon which it was
      built, with their beautiful green wreaths of leaves, met and roofed it
      over, thus constituting a natural covering for the protection of the young
      during the prevalence of inclement weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Brewer describes a nest taken by Mr. Brandigee in Berlin, Conn. This
      structure was elaborately and skilfully woven of long green blades of
      grass, lined on the inside with bits of yarn, animal wool, and a woolly
      substance of purely vegetable origin. In external diameter and height it
      measured four inches; in depth, three inches, and in internal diameter
      three and a half inches&mdash;being widest in the middle. Specimens,
      similarly colored, have been frequently observed in Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      By far the most remarkable structure which we have seen is the one we are
      about to describe. This domicile was built in a red or swamp maple, at an
      elevation of nearly thirty feet from the ground. It is a double nest,
      composed entirely of long, flexible, yellow grasses, and securely fastened
      between three nearly vertical branches, in a linear direction. The main
      nest is inversely sub-conical, four inches high, with an external diameter
      of three and a half inches in the middle, and four at the top. The
      diameter of the cavity is three inches, and the depth two and
      three-fourths inches. The smaller is joined to the first by a continuation
      of the grasses of the latter, is somewhat similarly shaped, but less
      compact in structure. The height is one and three-fourths inches, external
      diameter in the long direction three and one-fourth inches, and in the
      short, but two inches. The depth of the cavity is one and three-fourths
      inches, and the width, one and a half inches. In one side there is a
      circular hole one inch in diameter. Various opinions have been ventured as
      to the object of this additional structure. Some have contended that it
      was never intended for occupancy or ornament, but is simply a fabric which
      the authors have failed to complete. But its completeness and finish
      operate against such a theory. The writer, as well as others who have
      witnessed this curious specimen of mechanism, are convinced that it was
      erected for a special purpose&mdash;namely, the accommodation of either
      parent while the other is sitting. The opening alluded to, served for the
      head of the nonsitting bird, who, from his position, looking away from the
      main building, could detect the approach of enemies, like a sentry upon an
      outpost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest being completed, on the following day the female begins to
      deposit her complement of three or four eggs, at the rate of one egg
      daily. Incubation now ensues, sometimes on the day of the last deposit,
      but generally on the morrow. This duty lasts from fourteen to fifteen
      days, and is wholly the work of the female. While she is thus occupied,
      the male stands guard over the nest, or acts the part of a dutiful and
      affectionate husband, by providing her with the necessary food. Should
      their home be disturbed by feathered assailants, or by man, the female
      leaves the nest, and by loud cries and menacing gestures, seeks, with the
      assistance of her partner, to drive off the intruders. Often the attack is
      carried on with a boldness and determination that challenge admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The love for offspring is very intense, and manifests itself in unwearied
      devotion, and the tenderest solicitude. From early morn until dusk, one
      parent or the other is constantly on the go for appropriate articles of
      fare. Usually but one is absent at a time on this important business. But
      the demands for food are so pressing, that both are sometimes compelled to
      leave home, but only for a short time, and then never beyond seeing
      distance of the nest. At first the young are fed upon smooth caterpillars,
      aphides, spiders, ants, butterflies, and dipterous insects; but as they
      mature, small beetles and other hard-shelled articulates are added to
      their varied and extensive <i>menu</i>. At the age of fifteen days, they
      quit the nest, receive instructions in ærial navigation under the tutorage
      of the paternal head, and in ten days more, are prepared to shift for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      One peculiarity of this species must have struck the attention of every
      careful observer of its habits; that is, its remarkable sociability.
      Audubon cites a case where no less than nine pairs were found breeding in
      the same enclosure. We have known instances where as many as five nests,
      all occupied, were crowded in the same orchard, within a short distance of
      each other. The most perfect good feeling and harmony prevailed in this
      little colony, the birds mingling together with the freedom and ease of
      inhabitants of the best regulated human communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are oblong-oval in form, pointed at one extremity, and marked
      with pale purple blotches and a few deep dark purplish-brown dashes upon a
      light bluish-white background. Specimens from Washington measure .85 by
      .62 of an inch; from New Mexico, .79 by .54; and from Pennsylvania, .88 by
      .58.

      Plate V.&mdash;TYRANNUS CAROLINENSIS, Baird.&mdash;Kingbird.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Kingbird, or
      Bee Martin, has an extensive range, being found during the summer
      throughout the continent of North America, from Texas and Florida in the
      south, as far as the 57th parallel of north latitude. Westward, north of
      the 44th parallel, it ranges from the Atlantic seaboard to Oregon and
      Washington on the shores of the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its arrival in the United States from Mexico, Central and South America,
      and tropical Cuba, where it winters, generally occurs during the early
      part of April. Having taken the step, the birds are not long in spreading
      themselves over their immense breeding-grounds, which have been found to
      be co-extensive with the whole territory over which they range. They reach
      the Middle Atlantic States from the 20th of April to the first of May; the
      New England, from the first to the 10th of the latter month, and their
      more northern habitats, not later than the 15th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Careful observations, carried through a series of years, have convinced us
      that the appearance of the males always antedates that of the females by a
      week or ten days. Their advent is unheralded by song, or noisy
      demonstration, and is as mysterious as their departure. Our knowledge of
      the fact is mainly furnished by the eye, and not by the ear, which is
      ordinarily the first organ that apprises us thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most of its kin, the Kingbird is not gifted with a fine voice. When
      it does essay a madrigal, its shrill, unmusical syllables are anything but
      pleasing and welcome to the cultivated ear. It may be otherwise with
      beings of its own special class. At all events, his song, if such it can
      be truly called, has the anticipated effect&mdash;namely, that of calling
      from her wanderings, the partner, whose presence he is anxiously awaiting
      in his shady retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unblessed with the talent of producing sweet and soul-inspiring music,
      Nature has made amends for her seeming neglect by endowing him with
      certain mental and spiritual qualities which amply compensate for the want
      of a melodious voice. A noble, self-sacrificing nature, and a courageous
      but affectionate disposition, are traits of character which our little
      friend possesses in a remarkable degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aware of these high qualities, the female, never unduly coy, but innocent,
      arch and simple, seeks rather than shuns the society of her suitor, almost
      as soon as she has reached his whereabouts, and proudly but courteously
      receives his attentions, which, without any show or pretension, she
      generously reciprocates by consenting to become his companion and
      helpmeet. Consequently, the season of courtship is comparatively brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mating being accomplished, the newly-made couple, without much ado, and
      with but little waste of time, start off in quest of a suitable spot for a
      nest. This appears to be a difficult matter to settle. The pasture-grounds
      and waste places for which they have all along manifested a strong
      predilection, are deserted for the more congenial situations to be found
      about the home of man. Orchards of pear- and apple-trees, or an isolated
      pear-tree in close proximity to a human dwelling, are now visited. When
      the former, tree after tree is examined, and the particular advantages of
      each discussed, before one is found which answers all the requirements.
      These examinations often continue for a fortnight. The female seems to be
      the controlling spirit in these transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest is generally placed between the forked branches of a pear-tree,
      although the apple, cherry, osage orange, oak, cottonwood and tulip-tree
      are sometimes employed for this purpose. Why the pear should be preferred
      in certain localities above all other trees, it is difficult to divine,
      unless the density of its foliage, and the short spine-like twigs with
      which it is armed, afford security from the attacks of rapacious birds and
      mischief-loving boys. Mostly the birds select for building purposes the
      topmost boughs where the densest foliage abounds, although instances are
      known to us, through actual observation, where such structures have been
      found but five feet from the ground. Again, nests have been met with on
      the borders of deep forests, in situations remote from man, which fact
      seems to point to the conclusion that the habit of building in orchards
      has been acquired since the peopling of this country by human beings. The
      fondness of the Kingbird for the little honey-bee, whose hives are
      generally placed contiguous to human dwellings, has, doubtless, through
      the desire to be near such articles of luxury, prompted the change of
      habitat. This species, like one of its near congeners, occasionally builds
      upon the timbers of a bridge. Dr. Brewer mentions a case which came under
      his observation in the summer of 1851. While the doctor was passing over a
      bridge near the village of Aylesford, N. S., he was startled to see an
      individual of this species fly from a nest which was built on the
      projecting end of one of the planks of which the bridge was composed. "So
      remarkably exposed a position, open to view and on a level with and within
      a few feet of the highway," says he, "must be quite unusual." One fact
      which the same distinguished writer mentions, showing that the Kingbird,
      during the breeding-season, is not always the same ugly, pugnacious little
      creature which is claimed for him, must not be omitted in this connection.
      The circumstance to which we refer, occurred in the summer of 1871. A pair
      of these birds had built a nest in an apple-tree, near the doctor's
      residence and within four feet of the nest of the Baltimore Oriole, and
      not more than eight or ten feet from the abode of a couple of Robins, all
      in the same tree. These three pairs were on evident terms of friendship
      and good-will. The male Kingbird, from the topmost bough, kept a vigilant
      lookout for danger, and seemed to have all under his special care, but
      manifested not the slightest disposition to molest or annoy.

      Few species are more careless in the selection of nesting materials.
      Almost anything of the proper length and requisite degree of flexibility
      is utilized. Herbaceous stems, leaves of deciduous trees, strips of the
      inner bark of the flax, lichens, weeds, wrapping string, carpet rags,
      patches of cotton or wool, are a few of the many articles which are found
      on the outside; while slender grasses, fibres of bark, fine rootlets and
      horse-hairs constitute the inner arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical structure before us is rather loosely built exteriorly, but
      increases in compactness towards the interior, where the materials are
      more closely intermingled. The frame-work of this nest is composed of
      herbaceous stems, chiefly of the wheat and pigweed, large quantities of
      fibrous bark of a white, satiny lustre, and leaves of the oak, apple,
      pear, etc. The inside is formed of fine grasses, quite artistically and
      intricately laid in position. The cavity is beautifully symmetrical, and
      measures three inches in width, and two and a half in depth. The outside
      is five inches at the base, but contracts to four and a half at the mouth.
      The height is about four inches. This nest was obtained in the
      neighborhood of Chestnut Hill, Pa., June 15th, 1872.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another structure which the writer obtained in the same locality, only a
      few yards distant from the foregoing, differs slightly from it in form,
      but largely in composition. It is built of compressed stems of wheat,
      numerous and rather large scraps of printed paper, a few herbaceous
      plants, all closely compacted and curiously intermingled. Within, there is
      an inner fabric, secured to the former in a neat and substantial manner,
      and composed of dark stems and leaves of various species of grass, besides
      a small quantity of fine roots. The cavity is less regular than that of
      the other, and conspicuously shallow. It measures three inches in diameter
      and two in depth. The basal diameter is five inches, which is nearly the
      width at the mouth. The vertical thickness is three and a half inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Plate represents a very beautiful nest which was obtained in Southern
      New Jersey, in the summer of 1879. It was placed upon a cherry-branch, as
      shown in the drawing, at an elevation of fifteen feet from the ground. The
      outside consists of fine lichens, stems of grasses, wrapping string,
      roots, tassels of the oak and chestnut, and some mosses; the inside, of
      fine lichens, dried catkins of the oak, but largely of slender stems and
      rootlets. The external diameter is four and a half inches, and the
      thickness about one and three-fourths. The cavity is three inches wide,
      and one and a half inches deep. In the engraving it is shown the natural
      size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before drawing this part of our subject to a close, we cannot permit the
      occasion to pass without giving a brief description of one more nest which
      was obtained in June, 1880. It was placed upon the horizontal limb of an
      apple-tree, at an elevation of about ten feet from the ground. The
      peculiarity of this structure is the large number of carpet rags which
      depend therefrom. In most cases they extend from ten to fourteen inches
      beyond its lower border, thus contrasting very markedly with the dark
      stems and rootlets that make up the bulk of the exterior. Was this
      arrangement the result of blind chance, or were the rags placed there for
      some special purpose?
    </p>
    <p>
      The building of a home occupies the birds from four to five days. Did the
      builders work continuously at it from sunrise to sunset, the period of
      nidification would be considerably shortened. But such is not the ease.
      They seem to have no regular hours for labor, but only work as it suits
      their convenience. The duty of the male is to collect the materials; that
      of the female, to arrange them in suitable places. The nest being
      completed, scarcely a day passes before the first deposit is made.
      Subsequent deposits are made on consecutive days until the full complement
      is reached, when the female on the day following the last extrusion, takes
      the nest, and continues thereon, with brief intervals of intermission, for
      a period of thirteen or fourteen days, when her labors are repaid by the
      appearance of a nest-full of tiny fledglings. While she is thus occupied,
      the male acts the part of a dutiful and faithful husband, guarding her
      from danger, and supplying her with the choicest and most savory articles
      of food. When not foraging, he may be seen upon the topmost bough of the
      tree upon which the nest is placed, directly above his mate, on the
      constant lookout for danger. Should an enemy approach, he immediately
      gives vent to his displeasure by a few shrill twitterings, elevates his
      crest, and then gives chase to the intruder, whom he pursues for a
      considerable distance, all the while darting at him from different
      positions, and inflicting the severest punishment, in order to teach him
      the folly of trespassing. Owls, Eagles, Crows, Grakles, Jays, and even the
      common barnyard Hen, are made to feel the force of his vengeance; but his
      most implacable enemy is the Purple Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are objects of more than ordinary parental solicitude. The most
      endearing attentions are lavished upon them, and no efforts are spared to
      render them comfortable and happy. Caterpillars, flies, and other equally
      tender insects, are brought in great quantities, during the first few days
      of their existence, to satisfy the demands of their greedy appetites; but
      as they become larger, beetles and grasshoppers are added to their
      dietary. When fourteen days old, they quit the nest, but still remain
      under home influences for a fortnight later, when they are allowed to
      shift for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many particulars the eggs of this species resemble those of the
      Arkansas Flycatcher, but differ mainly in their somewhat larger size, and
      more pointed form. They are oval in shape, white in ground-color&mdash;except
      when fresh, when they show a roseate tinge&mdash;and beautifully spotted
      with brown and reddish-brown blotches and markings, which are confluent
      about the larger extremity in some, and irregularly scattered over the
      surface in others. They measure from 1.02 to .87 of an inch in length, and
      from .75 to .72 in width. Specimens from different parts of the country
      have been examined, and all, without exception, bear a very close
      resemblance to each other, scarcely differing more than do eggs of the
      same clutch.

      Plate VI.&mdash;AGELAIUS PHOENICEUS, Vieillot.&mdash;Redwing Blackbird.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Redwing
      Blackbird is found throughout North America, from ocean to ocean, and
      westward to the 57th parallel. From Texas and Florida to the plains of the
      Saskatchewan, wherever found, it breeds more or less abundantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the winter they congregate in large parties in Southern Virginia,
      the Carolinas, and all the Gulf States, especially near the sea-coast and
      among old fields of rice and grain. Occasionally, small flocks are found
      during the same season about stables and hay-stacks, in the vicinity of
      Vancouver. But in the Eastern, Middle, Western and Central sections, they
      are chiefly migrants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in March these large assemblies break up, a part separating in pairs
      and remaining among the Southern swamps, while the greater portion, the
      males leading the way, direct their movements northward. Later in April
      they have re-established themselves in their favorite and accustomed
      haunts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their arrival, the males consort together in high open fields, where
      their songs may be heard, at regular intervals, from morning until night.
      At this time they are rather suspicious, and can be approached only by the
      exercise of great caution. But when the females make their appearance,
      their attention becomes so absorbed, that they are apparently oblivious of
      events transpiring around them. The presence of the latter is the signal
      for redoubled vigor in the line of music. From bush and tree, from ground
      and fence-rail, and from almost every available place, in loud, clear and
      resonant notes, is heard their strange, unmistakable melody, each bird
      striving to outsing his companions. Ever and anon a half-dozen voices may
      be heard at the same time, producing a perfect medley of sounds, enough to
      "split the ears of the very groundlings." The males seem never to weary of
      singing. It is a remarkable and well-authenticated fact, that during the
      breeding-period, and even late in September when preparing to migrate, the
      same sweet but pensive strains are heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly three weeks have expired since the advent of the Redwing, and still
      the sexes remain unmated. This cannot long continue. Already a change is
      manifest. The males are more musical, while, on the other hand, a spirit
      of restlessness pervades the females. The latter are now no longer given
      to feeding as before, but cease from their labors, and bend listening ears
      to the gushing notes of love which swell around. Enraptured, impressed,
      they eventually emerge from their hiding-places, select their partners,
      and hie away to more congenial scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period of mating is unusually short, and unmarked by any special
      peculiarities. It generally occurs about the 20th of April, but seldom
      later than the beginning of May. The chief concern of the newly-wedded
      pair now seems to be the selection of a building-spot. This is a matter of
      importance, and, with most species, is attended with considerable
      difficulty. Not so in the present instance. The birds repair to accustomed
      sites, and there, amid the small bushes and tussocks which abound, prepare
      their houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nest-making commences in the Middle Atlantic States between the 25th of
      April and the 1st of May; in New England, about the 1st of June, but not
      before the middle of this month, in more northern regions. The nest is
      usually placed in a cluster of reeds, or in the tops of small bushes
      alongside of streams of water. Occasionally, small trees and fields of
      timothy are made the recipients of these marks of attention, and, in rare
      instances, the bare ground is made subservient to this purpose. Almost
      every ornithologist who has paid any attention to field-work has observed
      nests in their ordinary positions upon small hushes, or in bunches of
      swamp grass, but few, we opine, have met with them elsewhere. Mr. Maynard,
      as stated by Dr. Brewer, seems to have been the first to notice this
      change. While exploring an island in the marshes of Essex River, he found
      a number of nests in trees at an elevation of twenty feet from the ground.
      One of these structures, which was purse-shaped, was composed entirely of
      eel grass, and placed upon a sapling, at a height of fourteen feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      High grounds are seldom chosen for nidificating purposes, for the obvious
      reason that they offer poor facilities for food-collection; the aquatic
      larvæ, may-flies, dragon-flies, and mosquitoes, which constitute a
      conspicuous part of the diet of these birds, being only found in marshy
      situations. Even here a preference is manifested for certain positions.
      Small bushes along the borders of streams, from the two-fold advantages
      which they possess, are almost wholly adopted in some localities. Being
      convenient to appropriate food-stuffs, they are placed beyond the reach of
      snakes, particularly water snakes, which have a decided partiality for
      young birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having selected a building-spot, the pair proceed with all possible
      dispatch to construct a home. This requires the joint labor of the sexes,
      during the early mornings and evenings, for a period of about five days.
      The articles of composition are chiefly collected by the male, while the
      female performs the more difficult operation of putting them in position.
      Considerable differences are often noticeable in these structures. Those
      placed upon bushes are, as a general thing, more symmetrical and compact
      than those found in clumps of grasses, and differ still further in
      being-plastered with mud on the outside, which adds to their durability;
      while, on the other hand, nests enclosed by tall overarching grasses, have
      a looseness of arrangement that will scarcely bear manipulation. But where
      the nest is placed in fields of timothy and clover, there is evidence of
      great pains having been taken in its construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished their domicile, generally on the following day, but
      sometimes not for nearly a week afterwards, as is the case when mud and
      other damp substances have been used in building, the female begins to
      deposit her eggs, at the rate of one a day, until the full number of five
      has been laid. Incubation follows on the day of the last deposit, and
      continues for fifteen days. This business devolves wholly upon the female.
      While she is thus engaged, the male is not idle, but stands guard over the
      nest, or ventures off in quest of food for himself and companion. Should
      the nest be assailed, both parents seek, by the most piteous cries and
      remonstrances, to drive, off the offending party. In case of pillage, they
      keenly feel the injustice, and for several days bewail their misfortune.
      But they soon recover their usual spirits, and prepare to remedy the
      disaster. So tenacious are they of a chosen locality, that the same pair
      has been known to build as many as three nests in the same bush, after
      having been robbed twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parents show the most intense affection for their progeny. Day after
      day they watch over their helpless infancy with a devotion somewhat akin
      to that which a human mother manifests toward her child. Their slightest
      desire is a law, which is obeyed with cheerfulness and alacrity. When food
      is in demand, they prove themselves to be willing providers, each parent
      vying with the other in patience and fidelity. While one is absent in
      quest of food, the other remains at home to protect them from danger, the
      labor being accomplished by turns. Earthworms, caterpillars, fresh-water
      larvæ, flies and mosquitoes constitute their earliest fare. But later,
      beetles, butterflies, and various kinds of fruits help to swell their
      hitherto very extensive dietary. When about fourteen days old, the young
      leave the nest, but are not yet prepared to earn their own living. This
      requires an additional period of twelve days. Brood-raising being over,
      both young and old continue in the old haunts, until near the time of
      departure, when they collect in small flocks, and take up their
      southward-bound journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical nest of this species is somewhat irregular in shape, and rather
      coarsely and rudely built. It is composed of stubble and broad grasses
      variously intermingled, and lined with soft meadow grass. The dimensions
      vary according to locality. Several nests before us, from New Jersey,
      Pennsylvania, and the South and West, have an average external diameter of
      five inches, and a height of three. The cavities, however, are more
      uniform, and generally measure three inches in width, and one and a half
      in depth. But when a nest is built in a bush, the outer basketlike frame
      is carefully interwoven with, and strongly secured to, adjacent twigs.
      Though somewhat rudely put together, it is nevertheless firmly and
      compactly woven. The outer framework is usually made of rushes, strong
      leaves of the iris, and, in some instances, of an additional article
      apparently similar to mud. Within is packed a mass of coarse materials,
      over which is placed a thick lining of grasses and sedges. These nests, in
      the matter of size, differ from the former chiefly in the particulars of
      length and thickness. The internal dimensions offer no very striking
      exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest represented in the Plate is three-fourths of the natural size,
      and was obtained by the writer in the summer of 1879, by purchase, from
      Mr. Alexander M. Reynolds, of Philadelphia. It was built in a field of
      grass, many of the stalks of which being wrought in its composition. In
      figure it resembles an inverted cone, and is beautifully, symmetrically
      and compactly put together. The outside is formed of grasses and rushes,
      very neatly and intricately interwoven, and shows here and there a head of
      dried pappus plucked from some species of hawkweed. The inside is lined
      with sedges and fine blades of grass. As shown in the drawing, the nest
      occupies a rather conspicuous position. This was not the case in its
      natural location. Being found in the centre of a large field, it is at
      once evident that the authors had spared no pains to make the concealment
      as complete as possible. In height, this fabric measures nine inches. Its
      external diameters above, below, and in the middle, are, respectively,
      six, two, and four and a half inches. The width of the cavity is three
      inches, and the depth three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are oval in contour, of a light bluish ground-color, and are
      marbled, blotched and streaked with light and dark purple, chiefly about
      the greater extremity. In size, they vary considerably; the average length
      of a large number of specimens from different regions being 1.01 inches,
      and breadth .76. In the Middle, New England and Western sections of our
      country, this species is single-brooded; but further south, three, and
      even a larger number of broods, are annually raised.

      Humming-bird.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Ruby-throated
      Humming Bird is found throughout Eastern North America as far west as the
      Missouri Valley, and thence northward to the 57th parallel. It breeds from
      Florida and Western Texas to the plains of the Saskatchewan and the
      head-waters of the Elk River.
    </p>
    <p>
      From its winter-quarters in Guatemala and Mexico, it takes up its line of
      flight when the season has fairly opened, reaching our southern frontiers
      late in March. Thence it slowly advances northward in its migration,
      arriving in Upper Georgia about the 10th of April; in Pennsylvania, from
      the last of April to the Middle of May, and in its northern habitats,
      during the last of May, or the beginning of June.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a brief season subsequent to arrival the sexes remain apart, and seem
      only intent upon the procurement of food. This is especially the case in
      the Middle Atlantic States where their habits have been very closely
      observed. Here they make their appearance with the blossoms of the
      horse-chestnut and tulip-tree, and may be seen at all hours of the day, in
      fair weather, delving into flowers for honeyed sweets, or probing their
      bosoms for the caitiffs within. In feeding, their movements resemble those
      of the hawk-moths. Gracefully they suspend themselves in mid-air before
      the opening flowers, ravish their hidden treasures, and, with almost the
      speed of an arrow let fly from a bended bow by some skilled archer, are
      off in an instant, possibly to more delectable vineyards, or to some shady
      nook for rest and contemplation. For agility and fleetness of motion the
      little Ruby-throat is certainly unsurpassed by any of our smaller
      feathered species.
    </p>
    <p>
      But things cannot long remain in this state. Their favorite flowers must
      soon wither and decay, and with their timely death, must inevitably come
      the disappearance of an easy and luxurious means of subsistence. The tooth
      of appetite will then grow dull, and other thoughts and scenes invite
      their attention. Experience has taught us that the falling of the blossoms
      of the horse-chestnut and tulip-tree foretell the time of mating.
    </p>
    <p>
      This important business is performed without the least semblance of show.
      The sexes tired, as it were, of the riotous and luxurious lives they have
      been leading, come together by mutual agreement, and enter into
      matrimonial relations. This being accomplished, they separate for a brief
      period, and each proceeds to scour the country for miles around in quest
      of a suitable tree in which to locate. When one is selected by either
      bird, the other is summoned to the spot to talk over, in true
      bird-language, the merits thereof. Should the parties differ as to the
      advantageousness of the site, no quarrelling or bickering is indulged in,
      but, in the most friendly manner, they separate, and renew the search
      until one is found which gives satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having decided upon a locality, the birds are now ready to commence
      building. This takes place between the first and the tenth of June in the
      Middle States, about the tenth in New England, and as early as the fourth
      in the Southern Atlantic and Gulf States. The situations chosen vary
      considerably. Sometimes high, open woods are selected; again, low, dense
      thickets; but, more frequently, an orchard close-by a human dwelling, or
      an isolated tree in the midst of a lawn. Occasionally, the birds have been
      known to build in trees along travel-worn thoroughfares. A case in point
      came under our notice in the summer of 1872. While returning home one day,
      we were surprised to see a female fly from her nest in a maple-bough, only
      a few feet above our head. The nest was immediately examined, and found to
      contain a pair of young birds. Not wishing to disturb the happiness of the
      family, we permitted it to remain intact. On visiting the spot a week or
      ten days afterward, it was found to be empty, the birds either having
      matured and flown away, or else had been killed by some ruthless invader.
      For several successive years a nest was to be seen on the same tree and
      branch, but whether the work of the same pair, we are unable to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this species is not very particular as to the kind of tree in which
      it builds, has been our experience, and we do not find any recorded
      instance of disagreement. Dr. Brewer mentions but one kind of tree in
      which it builds&mdash;the apple. In addition to it, we have found nests
      saddled upon the pear, red-oak, white-oak, willow, red maple, sugar maple,
      cottonwood, beech, pine, etc. In fine, almost any tree will answer this
      purpose, as the generality of arboreous growths are more or less favorable
      to the development of lichens. Several anomalous positions, as on
      pine-cones and warty excrescences, have frequently been met with in our
      ornithological rambles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest is the result of the joint labor of both birds, who work with
      unwearied perseverance and diligence until it is completed; the male
      furnishing the raw material to be manipulated and adjusted by his zealous
      partner. Occasionally, the latter assists her "liege lord" in collecting
      and bringing in his burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of composition, there is but little difference in fabrics
      from the most distant regions. Nests from Texas are exact counterparts of
      those from Georgia; and these, again, resemble others from Pennsylvania
      and Michigan. All we have seen are composed mainly of a woolly substance
      of vegetable origin, plucked from the leaves of the common mullein, or
      from the young and unexpanded leaves of the various species of oak,
      immediately before their full development. This substance, after being
      wrought into form and symmetry, is strengthened on the outside by small
      woody fibres, or the webs of spiders. Over all is placed a close and
      compact thatching of small lichens, a species of Parmelia, glued thereon
      by the viscid saliva of the builders. On the inside may be frequently
      observed a thin lining of white feathers; and, on the outside, a few dried
      catkins. In dimensions, these nests usually measure one and a half inches
      in external diameter, and nearly one and three-fourths in height. The
      cavity is generally three-fourths of an inch wide at the rim, and the same
      in depth. Specimens have been met with which were but half an inch deep,
      and others which showed a much greater depth, as well as external height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest in the Plate is from Comal County, Texas, and was found upon a
      beech-tree. It is composed almost entirely of vegetable wool from the
      poplar and oak, and is lined with a few small white feathers. Externally,
      there is a dense covering of bluish crustaceous lichens and brownish
      oak-tassels, which are held in position by saliva and strands of spider's
      silk. It was placed upon a branch at an elevation of twenty feet above the
      ground. In height it measures one and three-fourth inches; in external
      diameter, one and a half. The width of the cavity is three-fourths of an
      inch, and the depth about a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nest obtained in Lynn, Mass., in June, 1860, was saddled on a horizontal
      branch of an apple-tree. It is woven of a soft woolly material, fine in
      texture, silky in appearance, and of the purest white color. Basally, it
      is strengthened with pieces of bark; and laterally, with fine vegetable
      fibres. The whole exterior is beautifully covered with a compact coating
      of lichens. It measures one and a half inches in height, and two and
      one-fourth in external diameter. The cavity is shallow, and is
      seven-tenths of an inch in depth, and one in width.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very beautiful nest, as well as a marked deviation from the normal form,
      as far as materials of composition are concerned, was discovered in June,
      1870, upon a branch of a red-oak which overhung a by-road, and within a
      few feet of a woollen factory. Scattered in the neighborhood was a lot of
      reddish shoddy, which had been discarded by the mill hands. The birds, it
      is evident, were not slow in perceiving the use to which this "waste"
      could be put. Accordingly they set to work, and, in a few days, had
      constructed a beautiful nest, at a saving of much labor and time. It might
      be thought there was a dearth of the usual materials, but this was not so,
      as a careful survey of the grounds soon satisfied us. Interiorly, this
      nest was entirely composed of this shoddy, while the exterior was covered
      with the ordinary lichens fastened to the nest proper by a few cobwebs and
      a secretion from the builders. In external diameter, it measured one and
      three-fourths inches; in height, two inches; in internal diameter,
      three-fourths of an inch, and nearly as much in depth of cavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest being finished, which is the work of five or six days, but a day
      or two elapse, and the female is ready to deposit her eggs. The latter, to
      the number of two, are laid in as many consecutive days. Incubation
      immediately ensues, and continues for a period of eight days. Its duties
      devolve upon the female, who sits with commendable patience until her task
      is accomplished. While thus employed, her mate stands guard, or is abroad
      in quest of food. If any attempt is made to interfere with the nest while
      he is on duty, the most menacing gestures and loudest remonstrances are
      indulged in. Should these not have the desired effect of frightening away
      the intruder, he darts at his foe with wide, open bill, and endeavors to
      inflict summary punishment. He is so persistent in these attacks that it
      is often very hard to beat him off. The female, on the contrary, is of a
      more passive nature, quietly keeping the nest, although not unmindful of
      the proceedings being enacted, and only venturing therefrom when danger is
      imminent. These assaults continue while the nest is endangered, and even
      for a short time afterwards, when the birds retire to a neighboring tree
      to brood over their mishaps, and consider what is best to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are objects of special interest to the parents, who render them
      every needed attention. When one is absent for food, the other stays at
      home to protect them from danger. Their food consists of a prepared
      mixture of nectar and soft insects, which they procure by thrusting their
      bills into the mouths of their parents. It was formerly supposed that this
      diet consisted entirely of the honey of flowers, but this opinion of the
      ancients was not wholly a fallacy, since a portion of nectar is taken with
      the insects, and supplies to the Humming-bird that kind of nourishment
      which the larger insectivorous birds derive from fruit. When eleven days
      old, these tiny creatures, in their beautiful robes of green, quit the
      nest, but necessarily remain under parental control a week longer, before
      they are able to support themselves. By some inexplicable circumstance,
      the young do not leave for their winter-homes until some time after their
      parents have departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are beautifully elliptical in outline, and of a pure dull white
      color. They measure .50 by .34 of an inch. Never more than a single brood
      is raised annually. Nests with eggs have been taken as late as the 20th of
      July, but these were doubtless laid by females whose early efforts had
      been interfered with.

      Bunting.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Towhee Bunting,
      or Ciieavink, has an extended distribution throughout the eastern portions
      of the United States, ranging from Florida and Georgia on the south-east
      to the Selkirk settlements on the northwest, and westward to the border of
      the Great Plains, where it is replaced by closely allied races. It breeds
      wherever found, certainly in Georgia, and, doubtless, in Florida, although
      sparingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Wilson, it is found in the middle districts of Virginia, and
      thence south to Florida, during the months of January, February and March;
      but as the weather grows mild, and Nature begins to don her livery of
      green, many forsake these haunts, and wing their flight to distant
      localities; reaching the Middle Atlantic States about the fifteenth of
      April, Massachusetts and Connecticut towards the last of the month, Maine
      and New Hampshire early in May, and the North-western States a little
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some regions the birds arrive singly, but retire in small flocks. This
      is the case in the vicinity of Washington; whereas in Eastern
      Pennsylvania, they are somewhat gregarious for a week or ten days after
      their arrival, when they separate, and lead solitary lives. Their sole
      object now is the acquirement of food. For this purpose they repair to
      waste fields and damp thickets, or to small patches of underbrush along
      frequented roads. Here their simple song may be heard during the intervals
      of feeding, with scarce an intermission, from five o'clock in the morning
      until eight in the evening, by the early or belated pedestrian. In rain or
      in sunshine, or at noonday in the hottest weather of the season, the woods
      resound therewith, or with that peculiar note of complaint from which the
      species has received the name Chewink.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an expression of cheerfulness in these notes, though they are not
      delivered with that enthusiasm which characterizes the songs of many of
      our species. But music, like poetry, must be of a somewhat plaintive
      nature, if it would take firm hold of the feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a period of three or four weeks mostly spent in feeding, the males
      seem to tire of such a life, and seek to attract the attention of the
      females. Perched on the lower branch of a tree, near the edge of a wood,
      or 011 the summit of a small tree or tall bush in the midst of a thicket,
      or hid from view by clusters of bushes, they may be heard pouring forth,
      with all the fervor of their being, their strange madrigals. At first,
      their efforts to captivate are unheeded. But patiently and persistently
      the singing is kept up in a quiet, simple manner, until their auditors
      become impressed, and modestly quit their shady retreats to encourage the
      musicians by their presence. Having gained this advantage, they follow it
      up, and in less than a week from the time the first note was uttered, have
      mastered the situation. The females wholly entranced, yield to the
      persuasions of their would-be lords, and conjugal relations are entered
      into. This generally occurs not later than the fifteenth of May. But the
      happy couple are not yet ready to begin nest-building. They must needs
      celebrate the occasion of their marriage. Accordingly, they set out on a
      wedding-trip, so to speak, visiting adjoining lots and thickets, and
      enjoying the delights and scenes around them. This continues for four or
      five days, when the lovers, thoroughly surfeited, return and quietly
      settle down to prosy life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The erection of a home is now the absorbing topic of interest and
      conversation. Where to build, and how, are matters that are agitating
      their minds, and which seem, judging from the actions of the parties
      interested, very difficult questions to adjust. After no inconsiderable
      portion of time thus spent, and with little possibility of coming to any
      decision, a separation ensues, and the country scoured for miles around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should a situation which seems eligible be discovered by either party, the
      other, by a peculiar signal, is called to the spot, and the advantages
      thereof carefully discussed. If satisfactory, it is accepted, and building
      operations commenced. Otherwise, the search is commenced anew, and
      continued until one is obtained which is mutually pleasing. But where the
      birds are unmolested, the same localities are probably selected on each
      return of the breeding-season. The situation generally chosen is a small
      thicket with a dense growth of underbrush, or a high piece of ground
      overrun by brambles, and dotted by patches of fern. Latterly, nests have
      been frequently found in clumps of tall grass, in fields once swampy in
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      In New England, the locality usually chosen is a low, dense woods,
      thickets of briers and bushes near streams of water, or the "scrub," which
      is a low or bushy "growth" of trees, chiefly of oaks and birches,
      occurring in dry, hilly lands once occupied by pines. In the extreme
      northern limits of its range, dry uplands, near the edges of woods, or
      high tracts covered with a. low brushwood, are used, rather than low or
      moist grounds, as was the case in some sections at the time when Wilson
      wrote. The love for such situations doubtless gave rise to the appellation
      of "Swamp Robin," which is generally applied to this species in
      Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      When placed within a thicket, or in the borders thereof, the nest is
      either built in a depression of the ground, usually beneath a bunch of
      grass, in a pile of old brush or fagots, or on a slight prominence
      surrounded by tall, graceful ferns. Within a concavity, the structure is
      made to project slightly above the margin thereof, and is artfully
      concealed from the gaze of intruders by dry leaves. So completely is it
      hidden, that all efforts to find it frequently prove unavailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of building is entered into with diligence and alacrity, each
      bird collecting and adjusting the materials as it thinks best. While thus
      engaged&mdash;which is usually from sunrise to sunset, allowing the
      necessary time for foraging and rest&mdash;the architects seldom, if ever,
      get at outs, but labor with a purpose, and in the best of spirits. The
      time thus spent has never been known to exceed three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      So little variation is manifested in these structures, that specimens from
      the Southern States resemble those from the Eastern, Middle and Western
      sections so closely, as to be readily identified by persons of the least
      experience in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical nest is mainly composed of the leaves of deciduous trees, twigs,
      grass and roots, 011 the outside, and is lined with the inner fibres of
      the wild grape-vine, or with fine stems of grasses. The drawing represents
      it as being constituted of the stems of grasses, with a slight
      intermixture of leaves and roots, and as having a lining of reddish-brown
      stems of the same. It measures four and a half inches in extreme diameter,
      and two and a half in height. The internal diameter is two and
      three-fourths inches, and the depth of cavity one and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oviposition commences on the day succeeding the completion of the nest,
      and proceeds at the rate of one egg daily, until the entire complement is
      deposited. Incubation closely, follows, usually a day or two after the
      last egg is laid. This is undoubtedly the exclusive task of the female for
      a period of thirteen days. Diligent and close watching has failed to show
      that the male takes any direct part in this important business. Although
      seemingly averse, or unaccustomed to this kind of work, he does not fail
      to contribute his share to the success of the undertaking. While his wife
      is engaged in sitting, he is an ever watchful and cautious husband. Unlike
      many other species, he does not make himself too conspicuous, but stations
      himself some distance from the nest, for fear of revealing its
      whereabouts, and only ventures into the neighborhood at certain regular
      periods, to receive the commands of his patient little house-wife, or to
      administer to her bodily wants. Though shy, these birds often seem saucy;
      and, while one person complains of their chirruping to and starting his
      horse, another claims that, 011 the discovery of their nest, they express
      their grief so impudently as to arouse his indignation. But when the nest
      lias been stumbled upon by some cruel oologist, and the female is
      compelled to abandon it and seek safety in flight, the male does not even
      then desert his hiding-place to come to her rescue. Everything is left to
      her judgment, and well does she play her <i>role</i> in the drama. By
      various strategic movements, such as imitating the actions and cries of a
      crippled bird, she decoys the inexperienced intruder to a remote distance,
      when she flings off' the veil of hypocrisy, and quickly disappears in the
      bushes. With the trained collector this <i>ruse</i> hardly succeeds, and
      the disappointed parent often beholds with profound sorrow the discovery
      of her nest, and its destruction by ruthless hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young are hatched, they are watched over with jealous care, and
      receive more than ordinary attention. Grubs, earthworms, plant-lice and
      larvæ of butterflies, in immense numbers, are daily gleaned, and fed to
      their hungry appetites. Such are their demands for food, during the first
      week or ten days of existence, that the parents are kept extremely busy in
      catering thereto. Occasionally, both are absent from home 011 this
      important business, but the rule seems to be for one parent to keep a
      watch over it and its helpless inmates, while the other is thus occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of thirteen or fourteen days, the young quit the nest, and
      receive their first lessons in the mysteries of bird life; and, in ten
      days more, are forced to shift for themselves, but are permitted, however,
      to remain with the parents until the time of the autumnal migration, when
      they help to form the small flocks which are seen flying southward about
      the middle of October.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species are four in number, rounded-oval in shape, and
      are covered over the entire surface with dots and blotches of
      reddish-brown upon an obscure grayish, or reddish-white background. In
      some specimens, these dots run into each other; and, in others, they are
      distinct, being more profusely collected about the larger extremity. The
      average measurement of a score of specimens from widely-separated
      localities is .97 by .80 of an inch. Such is the resemblance which obtains
      between these eggs and those of the Brown Thrush, that when sets of both
      are placed together in a tray, the difference between them would scarcely
      be apparent to a novice in such matters. It remains for the keen and
      critical eye of the more advanced student to point out the distinction,
      which consists in the paler and more roseate tint of the Chewink's eggs,
      and the larger size of those of the Thrasher. Wherever observed, these
      birds seem to be single-brooded, although nests are sometimes found with
      young, in June and August, which fact would seem to argue that
      occasionally more than one brood is reared; but, generally, the first
      brood leaves the nest too late for another to be brought out before the
      appearance of the early frosts.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Downy
      Woodpecker, or Lessee Sapsucker as it is called byway of distinction, is a
      resident rather than a migratory species, and is known to breed wherever
      it is found. Its area of distribution extends from Lower Louisiana to
      Labrador, and from Texas northward through New Mexico and the Indian
      Territory to the 58° of latitude. It is also quite common in the maritime
      parts of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands excepted. Although abundant east of
      the Rocky Mountains, and rather more numerous than its nearest kin, the
      Larger Sapsucker, yet, owing to the smallness of its size, it is not so
      well known outside of cultivated districts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the autumnal and winter months, these birds lead solitary lives. Go
      where we will, then, we may here and there behold isolated individuals
      busily probing the fissured bark of trees for the eggs and pupa of
      insects. Even the mature forms meet with the same cruel treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though rarely observed in cultivated districts during these times, yet a
      visit to the woods will reveal many a little fellow in dappled dress
      arrayed, with or without a crown of red, wending his slow and labored
      flight from tree to tree, or waking the clear echoes of rock and shady
      glen with his shrill music and weird drumming.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when balmy Spring returns, and releases the earth from the icy fetters
      of the winter-god, and peoples our shade and fruit trees with countless
      insect existences, then quits he the wild forest scenery, in a measure,
      and betakes himself to our lawns and orchards. This is not always the
      case. For in those lands where civilization has not planted, but where
      Nature still reigns in her pristine glory, lie is the same changeless
      creature as when first he greeted the vision of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis now the social forces, freed from the frozen bonds of winter, rejoice
      in new vitality. The sexes no longer shun each other as before, but mingle
      in the most friendly manner. The male is the first to show symptoms of
      change. He pursues his predatory exploits with less of his characteristic
      zeal, and seeks to attract the attention of the gentler sex. With this
      object in view, he arranges his toilet with scrupulous nicety, and then
      goes forth to parade his beauties and grace before a bevy of idle,
      listless females. Ever and anon, he varies his occupation, by the
      rendition of a song. But his auditors seem either incapable of
      appreciating his efforts to please, or else are too much concerned with
      other matters to pay any real attention thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our little hero, not to be baffled, keeps up his courage, and with a
      patience truly praiseworthy, continues his suit, till at last he reaches
      the ear of some simple-minded female, when he pours forth, with all the
      resistless eloquence of his being, the short but pleasing narrative of his
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should his affection be requited as it deserves, the happy lovers, without
      further ado, hie themselves away to sunny field or shady grove, to enjoy a
      brief honey-moon, preparatory to entering upon the trying and responsible
      duties of wedded life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The getting of a wife is not always so easily accomplished. It is
      generally attended with many trials and vicissitudes of fortune. Sometimes
      when success seems ready to crown the efforts of an actor in this part of
      life's drama, a rival comes upon the scene, and claims the attention of
      the wooed. The most ridiculous antics now ensue, and continue for hours
      together. The female becomes the most whimsical of creatures, lavishing
      her caresses first upon one, and then upon the other of her suitors. The
      jealousy of the contesting males now knows no bounds, and only vents
      itself in long and fierce encounters. The female, at last, comes to the
      rescue, desists from her meaningless flirtation, and bestows the jewel of
      her affections upon her first lover. The combat ceases, and the
      participants separate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally, several pairs will meet by chance upon the same tree, when
      similar scenes will be enacted by the jolly females, much to the vexation
      of their respective suitors. These farces have been known to last for
      nearly a week, but they seldom continue for a longer period than two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mating having taken place, which is usually the case during the first week
      of May, never earlier except when the season is remarkably advanced, the
      birds make ample amends for the time thus seemingly frittered away, by the
      perseverance and diligence with which they ransack the orchards and groves
      for a suitable tree in which to excavate a nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The selection of a site is a matter of no little importance, the greater
      part of a week being consumed in making the necessary reconnoissances.
      These explorations commence early in the morning, and continue with but
      few interruptions until the close of the day. They are never performed
      singly, but always in pairs. One feature thereof strikes us as peculiarly
      interesting, and as deserving of mention. It is the perfect harmony and
      good-will which then prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a situation is discovered by one of the parties which is apparently
      suitable, a conference is called, and the various advantages thereof
      discussed. If mutually agreeable, further examinations cease, and building
      operations are begun. In cultivated grounds, a decayed branch of the apple
      or cherry is chosen for this purpose; but in more retired situations, the
      maple, ash, elm or tulip-tree is given the preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Southern States, nest-building commences about the middle of April;
      in the Middle Atlantic, seldom later than the fifteenth of May; in New
      England, from the fifteenth of May to the tenth of June; and in the
      extreme northerly portions of its habitat, about the fifteenth of the
      latter month.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things being in readiness, the male is the first to commence
      operations. Stationing himself upon the spot which is to constitute the
      doorway to his home, with claws imbedded in the wood to prevent from
      falling, he digs the bark away in the form of a semi-circle. Then
      reversing his position, he goes through the same difficult but trying
      task, his little bill his only implement of execution, until he has
      wrought a perfect circle. Continuing the labor, he delves away into the
      soft or hardened interior, like a veritable Trojan, until an inch or more
      of the wood has yielded to the blows of his small but powerful chisel.
      Tired, at last, he resigns the work to his companion, and settles himself
      upon a branch close-by to rest. Having recuperated his exhausted energies,
      he starts off in quest of food, but to return in the course of a half-hour
      to the relief of the female. Thus the work goes on, day after day, with an
      industry and patience truly commendable, until success crowns the
      undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening to the chamber is perfectly circular, and quite as accurate as
      a skilful mechanic could make it with compasses. The cavity is first
      directed downwards at an angle of forty degrees, for the space of five
      inches, when it takes a perdendicular course for nearly ten inches
      further, widening perceptibly at the bottom. Such is the capacity of the
      latter that the sitting-bird is able to turn around therein with
      considerable ease, but the external orifice is just large enough to admit
      the bodies of herself and partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few species are more careful to direct attention from the scene of their
      labors than the subjects of our sketch. The chips produced during the work
      of excavation are usually carried to some distance, so as to remove all
      traces that might lead to detection. But howsoever clandestinely they may
      act, and whatever precaution they may exercise, their home does not always
      escape the keen eye of the experienced oologist, or the sharpness and
      sagacity of the mischievous and insinuating little House Wren&mdash;one of
      the most annoying enemies with which it has to contend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson gives an interesting account of the impudent coolness of this bird,
      who coveting the neatly built home of this Woodpecker, and powerless to
      construct such an apartment for herself, waits until the Wookpeckers have
      finished their work, when she attacks them with violence, and expels them
      from the nest which they have prepared with so much pains. Another example
      is mentioned by the same distinguished authority. In this instance, the
      Woodpeckers had commenced the work of excavation in a cherry-tree, within
      a few yards of the house in which he lived, and had made considerable
      progress, when they were assailed by the Wrens, and compelled to withdraw.
      They then began a second nest in a pear-tree, a few yards off' when after
      digging out a most complete chamber, and laying one egg, they were once
      more attacked by the same impertinent intruder, and finally forced to
      desert the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having constructed their home, which is usually the work of a week, the
      female, after a day of recreation and rest, begins the labor of
      oviposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This continues for four or six days, the time being regulated by the
      number of eggs which is to constitute a setting, but a single egg being
      deposited daily. Incubation now follows, and is the exclusive task of the
      female for nearly twelve days. The male, although he takes no direct part
      in this business, is an important factor in the successful accomplishment
      of the undertaking, as he, like an affectionate and dutiful husband,
      supplies her with the necessary food. When not thus occupied, he may be
      seen foraging the fields and woods, or perched upon a twig in the calm
      enjoyment of ease and sober thought, He is seldom to be observed in the
      immediate vicinity of the nest, save when carrying food to his mate, or in
      times of great calamity. It has been affirmed by Mr. Paine, of Randolph,
      Vermont, that the male occasionally constructs a hole for himself close-by
      that of his mate, as he has taken males in such apartments which were
      always unoccupied by eggs. He thinks that they repair thither for shelter.
      Careful explorations for several years have failed to show us that any
      such protection is practised in the Middle States, nor do we find any
      record to substantiate this statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young, when first hatched, are very helpless creatures, and require
      the greatest care and attention from parental hands, so to speak.
      Caterpillars, small moths, aphides and beetles constitute the bulk of
      their fare, from the time they leave the egg until they are four weeks
      old, when they quit the nest, to be instructed in the ways of the outside
      world. For a fortnight the young birds rove in company, but finally
      separate, each bird leading the life of a recluse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species are nearly spherical, of a crystalline whiteness,
      and measure .82 of an inch in length, and .71 in width. Specimens from
      Eastern Texas and Southern Michigan differ but little, if any, from others
      obtainable in New England and the Middle sections of our country. In the
      Plate the eggs are shown in position, the wood being cut away over the
      bottom of the chamber, to produce this result. The egg in front, as well
      as the birds upon the branch, are three-fourths of the natural size. The
      remaining eggs are in part concealed, and do not show so fully. In the
      southern and middle portions of the range of this Woodpecker, two broods
      are annually raised, one in June, and the other in August, but further
      north seldom more than one.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Red-eyed Vireo
      is quite an abundant species throughout Eastern North America, ranging
      from Florida in a northeasterly direction to Nova Scotia, thence
      northwesterly to Lake Winnipeg and Washington Territory, and westerly to
      Ogden, Utah. Accidental specimens have been procured in Greenland and
      England, but never more than a single individual in each locality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these birds winter in Florida, and as specimens have been met with
      in Central America, Cuba, Trinidad, and on the Isthmus of Panama, it is
      highly probable that many betake themselves thither when the period of
      breeding is over in their northern homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in March the latter enter the United States, possibly by way of
      Texas and Florida, and wend their movements northward, reaching the Middle
      States late in April; the New England, about the middle of May; and the
      extreme northwest, a fortnight later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all of its peculiar and characteristic genus, this species affects a
      fondness for forests, or the summits of tall trees, but seldom ventures
      upon the ground. It is, however, not wholly sylvan. At times it may be
      found around dwellings, or along the shaded streets of rural towns, in
      quest of the various insects which contribute to its sustenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it gleans among the tree-tops, the simple, pleasing and musical notes
      of the male may be heard at somewhat regular intervals. So unsuspicious
      and familiar is he then, that passers-by may come and go, and their
      presence be unheeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the hot and sultry hours of noon when other songsters have ceased
      their warblings and foraging, and have slunk to the refreshing shades for
      comfort and security, our little friend continues to pour forth in loud,
      sonorous notes his peculiar <i>te-te-tu'eah-we-ah-tweah-tweah-tweet</i>.
      Being the earliest of our vernal choristers, he is also the most constant
      and untiring, and continues to sing throughout the entire season. Even
      when about to depart for the smiling scenes of his southern home, he
      thrills the air of woodland and valley with impassioned song.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tender and pathetic utterances, which resemble the melodious notes of
      the Robin, but lacking their volume and power, are produced with so much
      apparent animation, judging from their sound, as to be in striking;
      contrast to the seeming indifference or unconsciousness of the plain
      little vocalist who, while regaling the listener, appears all the while to
      be bent upon the procurement of his daily food, which he pursues with
      great ardor. But with the female the case is different. Although quite as
      active a feeder as the male, yet there is apparent none of that bustle and
      noise which characterize his movements. Her chief concern seems to be the
      satisfaction of hunger, and a studious avoidance of the male.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the days multiply, and insect life becomes more common, which is
      generally the case about two weeks after their arrival, less anxiety is
      felt on account of food; consequently, more time is left for the
      development and play of the social forces. The sexes now begin to manifest
      less reserve and coolness, and instead of shunning each other, as was
      their wont, are brought more and more into friendly intercourse. A week or
      ten days later, and the way is paved for the assumption of matrimonial
      relations. In this movement, the male takes the lead. The female, somewhat
      coy, at first listens to the wooings of her suitor at a wary distance, but
      as time progresses, soon learns to regard him in the light of a lover,
      throws off her restraint, and confidently advances to receive his
      caresses. And thus events follow each other in rapid succession until a
      union is effected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having mated, the happy pair, with no more delay than is absolutely
      necessary, start off together in search of a nesting-place. This is a
      matter that is easily accomplished, as almost any forest-tree of small or
      medium height, answers the purpose. In some situations, the beech, maple,
      sassafras and common laurel are in special demand. Why this is so, it is
      impossible to divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      High woods, with an abundance of small trees, are generally chosen. Here,
      the nests are not often placed higher than five or six feet above the
      ground. Sometimes, though rarely, they are found swinging from a pendent
      bough, more than fifty feet high. Nidification seldom occurs in
      compactly-built cities. Never more than a single instance has ever been
      observed by us. This happened in the summer of 1876.
    </p>
    <p>
      A site being chosen, building at once commences. This occurs in the Middle
      States between the twelfth of May and the fifteenth of June; in New
      England, about the first of the latter month; in Texas and Louisiana,
      somewhat earlier; and in Nova Scotia, a trifle later. At Fort Resolution,
      at the Cumberland House, and at Fort Simpson, nests and eggs have been
      taken, but we are left in ignorance as to the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The construction of a home is the result of the united labors of both
      birds, each collecting and adjusting its own materials. The time devoted
      thereto varies from six to seven days, and is regulated by the industry of
      the builders and the <i>condition</i> of the weather. For this purpose a
      bifurcated branch is first chosen. To this is attached, by means of
      cobwebs, strips of bark, threads of moss, and the silk of caterpillars, a
      delicate framework. This is mainly composed of bark, decayed pine-wood,
      vegetable fibres, etc., held together by silk, and, possibly, in a slight
      degree, by a gummy secretion supplied by the builders. This structure is
      long, tenuous, open and narrow, presents a somewhat collapsed appearance,
      and resembles, though remotely, the perfect fabric. But it lacks shape and
      symmetry. To give it these essentials, the birds construct an inner nest
      out of bits of paper, fragments of hornets' nests, and strips of oak bark,
      which are so arranged as to protrude through the interstices of the outer.
      It is now the duty of the female, by a few bodily evolutions, to reduce
      the whole to form. This accomplished, the labor of building is resumed,
      and a cozy lining, composed of narrow strips of the inner bark of the wild
      grape-vine, is added. Often white and black horse-hairs take the place of
      these articles. That this species builds after the fashion described, is
      proved by actual observation, and also by the finding of abandoned nests
      which showed the outer, but not the inner arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest represented in the Plate came from Atlantic Co., N. J. It was
      built between a forked branch of the common laurel. Externally, it is
      composed of decayed wood, inner bark of plants, silk of caterpillars,
      fragments of hornets' nests, cocoons of spiders, etc. Internally, there is
      a thick lining of the inner bark of the wild grape-vine. The external
      diameter is three and a half inches; internal, two and a half inches;
      outside depth, two and a quarter, and inside, one and three-fourths
      inches. A comparison with specimens from Texas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and
      Massachusetts, shows marked similarities in structure and details of
      composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the collection of the Smithsonian Institution there is to be seen a
      nest which was obtained by Mr. Kennicott at the Cumberland House, on the
      Saskatchewan River. It is pensile, like all others, but is almost
      exclusively built of pine-needles&mdash;a dry and hard material, difficult
      of management in the construction of such a domicile. With these are
      intermingled flax-like vegetable fibres, fine strips of bark, and
      fragments of moss. Within is placed an inner nest composed of strips of
      bark, pine leaves and fine, dry grasses. The external fabric is rather
      loosely put together&mdash;an unusual feature&mdash;but the inner portion,
      in the compactness and strength with which it was made, is in striking
      contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the nest is finished, the female, on the ensuing day, and
      occasionally not until the expiration of the third or fourth, commences to
      lay her eggs, at the rate of one daily, until the entire complement of
      three or four has been laid. Incubation follows closely, usually on the
      day succeeding the last deposit, and continues for nearly eleven days.
      This is not the exclusive task of the female, as the male sometimes
      assists her. When the latter is not thus occupied, it is seldom that he
      may be found in the vicinity, being absent either designedly, or in search
      of food. Should the nest be approached at this time, the female sits
      close, and seems to manifest neither timidity nor alarm. We have often
      surprised her on the nest, and reached out our hand to take her, when she
      would watch our actions very narrowly, as if seeking to study our motives,
      but remaining perfectly motionless all the while. A nearer approach was
      invariably followed by her sudden departure therefrom. The bird would not
      wholly desert the nest, but demurely station herself upon an adjoining
      twig, in order to watch our actions. But with the male it is quite
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any attempt at disturbance or pillage is resented with spirit and courage,
      especially when the nest contains young birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The home of this Vireo is often chosen by the Cowbird as a place of
      deposit for her eggs. So singularly devoted to their alien guests do these
      foster-parents become, that they nurture them very tenderly, even to the
      neglect of their own offspring. A case is mentioned where three of these
      parasitic eggs had been deposited in the nest of the Vireo before any of
      her own. Without laying any, the female Vireo proceeded to set upon and
      hatch the intruders. Another case is cited where two Cowbird's eggs were
      laid alongside of two of the Vireo's. The latter immediately stopped
      laying and proceeded to incubate. In each of these cases it is evident
      that the female Vireo forewent her own maternal instincts, and at once
      conformed to the new situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are objects of special parental interest. From the time they are
      hatched, until the period of their leaving the nest to earn a livelihood,
      they are watched over, and fed with the daintiest fare which Nature
      affords. Caterpillars, diptera, plant-lice, small spiders and berries,
      constitute their earliest diet; but as they increase in size and strength,
      other articles of a coarser nature are added. At the age of twelve days
      they vacate the nest, but continue under the watchful eyes of their
      parents a week longer, when they are able to forage for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anxieties of brood-raising being over, both young and old, the former
      in imitation of their parents, seek the tall tree-tops and glean in
      company. Later, they come down from these lofty retreats to delve among
      the grasses. Finally, as if disdaining too near an approach to earth, they
      quickly forsake such groveling pursuits, and seek the viburnum and dogwood
      bushes, where they find many a rich repast. Here they remain until the
      last of September, or the beginning of October, when cold weather and
      scarcity of food compel them to hunt warmer climes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this Vireo vary considerably in size, according to locality;
      the further south the smaller they are found. Specimens from Northern
      Alabama have an average measurement of .77 of an inch by .52; from Nova
      Scotia, .94 by .65; from Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, intermediate
      localities, .82 by .56, and .83 by 62. The ground-color of all is a clear
      crystal-white, and they are marked with spots and fine dots of red-brown,
      which are chiefly found at the larger extremity. But a single brood is
      raised, although nests with eggs have been taken early in July, which must
      be attributed to birds whom accident or design had prevented from obeying
      their natural instincts earlier.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Spotted
      Sandpiper has an extended and varied distribution throughout North
      America. Unlike most of its allies, it breeds with equal readiness
      wherever found, and is one of the best known and most abundant of all its
      tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      From its winter-quarters in the Southern States, and also in the West
      Indies and Central and South America, to Brazil, it takes up the line of
      migration about the tenth of April, and gradually spreads itself over
      nearly the whole country as far north as Labrador and Fort Yukon.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Mr. Trippe, it is the only species of its family that resorts
      to the mountains of Colorado. Here, it arrives early in May, and departs
      in September. All the larger streams, to an altitude of 8,000 or 9,000
      feet, are visited, and, even, in some instances, the shores of the lakes
      near the timber line.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their first arrival, the banks of large rivers are frequented; but as
      the season advances, many trace their way into the interior, along the
      courses of our creeks and rivulets. Their sole object now is the
      acquirement of food. For this purpose, a life of solitude is preferable to
      any other. Although three or four individuals may frequently be discovered
      together upon the same feeding-grounds, yet careful and repeated
      observations have convinced us that this occurrence is merely accidental,
      and not dictated by a desire for company. At such times, the birds become
      so deeply absorbed in the business before them, that the approach of human
      beings is unobserved, and the actors are only aroused from the stolidity
      and indifference into which they have fallen, by the crackling of a dead
      branch, or the dislodgment of a pebble from its mooring. Conscious of
      impending danger, but never stopping to inquire into the cause of the
      alarm, they seek safety in instant flight, and repair to other scenes, at
      no great distance from the former, whore they think to pursue their
      gastronomic occupation without fear of being molested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the colors of this species, that the utmost harmony obtains
      between them and the hues of surrounding objects. The keen eye of the
      practised sportsman is often eluded thereby. Were it not for its peculiar
      habit of wagging the tail, it would be a very difficult bird to locate,
      especially when in a standing attitude; for whether thus occupied, or
      running on the ground, or along the rails of a fence, or in the water,
      this motion seems continual. Even the young, as soon as they are released
      from the shell, are taught by instinct the same remarkable movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually about the third week from the time of their first appearance, but
      sometimes later, the sexes, grown corpulent from good feeding, discard in
      a measure the "joys of the table," and seek each other's society. From
      stilly bank of inland pond or stream, or where old Neptune lashes in
      frenzied mood his solid flanks, their strange and simple call, <i>peet-iveet,
      peet-weet</i>, may be heard in quick succession, louder, and more
      distinct, than was their wont. Nor do the males alone indulge therein; for
      the gentler sex oft join their lords in wanton rivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less whimsical than their aristocratic neighbors who affect the tall
      tree-tops and shady bushes, the lady Sandpipers are more easily wooed and
      won. Their ardent lovers have but to make their suits with due
      obsequiousness, to receive the courted promises. A few more avowals of
      love, and caresses, and the necessary reciprocations on the part of the
      females, and the happy lovers having sealed their plighted pledges in a
      bond of union, the respective parties journey off in search of suitable
      places for establishing their homes. This event generally occurs about the
      last of May, in some localities, but sometimes not earlier than the second
      week of June, in others, and, perhaps, later in the extreme northern
      limits of its habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A period of three or four days being spent in examining the surrounding
      country, the various parties soon settle upon localities. While some
      prefer the borders of ponds and streams, or more retired and secluded
      situations in the midst of forests, or a corn-field on elevated ground,
      others, again, have a hankering for low, sandy islands, or marshes by the
      sea-coast, or even the almost barren beach itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This part of the business being attended to, each female begins to
      construct her nest. For this purpose she scratches a slight hollow in the
      sandy earth, and proceeds to line it with a few pieces of straw, or moss,
      or sea-weed, the nature of the materials depending upon the <i>environment</i>.
      When the nest is placed in a corn-field, it is generally built at the root
      of a hill of Indian corn, and is either lined with straws, or mosses; when
      upon the seashore, various species of algae are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished her rather simple and hastily-constructed home, with as
      little delay as possible the female commences to deposit her complement of
      four eggs. This she does at the rate of one egg a day, in as many
      consecutive days, taking due care to place them with the small ends
      together in the middle of the nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last egg deposited, the female, on the day thereafter, enters the
      nest, and commences the duty of incubation. She is not necessarily a very
      close sitter, especially when her nest is located in a sandy soil, as the
      heated sand has doubtless much to do with the development of the young.
      During inclement weather, protection is absolutely essential;
      consequently, one bird or the other must occupy it, by turns, until the
      necessity has passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While one is incubating, it does not appear that her partner is compelled
      to play the part of a purveyor of food. Careful examinations have never
      enabled us to detect the least evidence thereof. When either party is
      tired, or is severely pressed by hunger, the other is summoned to the
      spot, to receive the charge of affairs. Thus the business goes on for
      eighteen weary days, when the happy parents are blessed with a jolly
      little family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are not the mere helpless creatures such as we have all along
      been describing, but as active beings, for the age, as it is possible to
      conceive of. Clad in silken robes of drab, with beautiful stripes of black
      adown the back, they constitute a merry, rollicking group of birdies. The
      world to them is a paradise of beauty, and a garden-spot of pleasure. As
      soon as they leave the shell, they run with remarkable speed, and
      otherwise exhibit a precocity which seems unnatural at that period of
      life. Feeding, like running, is instinctive. It cannot be that it is
      learned by imitation, any more than the exercise of the cursorial powers
      can be said to be thus acquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although much of the trouble and care which birds generally bestow upon
      their offspring are thus saved to these fortunate parents, yet the power
      to discriminate between bad and good food, has to be learned by attention
      to the commands and actions of wiser heads. The young are not slow to
      profit from parental suggestions and instruction, for we find them, at the
      expiration of a fortnight, engaged in foraging with the judgment and
      adroitness of adults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few species exhibit symptoms of greater distress than these Sandpipers
      when their breeding-grounds are approached by human beings. The parents
      resort to every conceivable stratagem in order to draw the intruders away.
      Counterfeiting lameness, and fluttering along the ground with seeming
      difficulty, are two of the most characteristic devices which they practise
      for this purpose. But the appearance of a dog considerably heightens the
      agitation. It is very interesting to watch the actions of the female on
      such occasions. In order to lead him away from her terrified young, she
      throws herself before him, flutters away in a contrary direction, but
      always managing to keep out of the reach of danger. This she continues for
      some time, until the animal has been drawn to a considerable distance,
      when she throws off the garb of dissimulation, and takes to flight,
      leaving her pursuer standing stock-still and gazing with astonishment and
      disappointment at the remarkable transformation which has just been
      effected. While all this has been going on, the young have scurried away
      to places of shelter and security, where they are afterwards joined by
      their beloved parent, glad to have escaped so fearful a calamity, and
      grateful for such a happy deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more substantial proof of the affection of this female for its young
      could hardly be imagined than that which Wilson gives on the authority of
      Mr. William Bartram. The scene of action is described as being on the
      river shore, and the occasion, the repeated attempts made by a ground
      squirrel to capture two young birds which a parent was trying to defend.
      In order to ward off the assaults of the squirrel, she had thrown her two
      young behind her. At every attempt of the animal to seize them by a
      circuitous sweep, she would raise her wings almost perpendicularly, assume
      the most formidable expression of which she was capable, rush forward upon
      the squirrel, who, intimidated by the boldness of her manner, would beat a
      precipitate retreat. The enemy, recovering from his defeat, would
      presently return, and renew the attack, but to be ingloriously driven back
      as before. The young, as though sensible of their perilous situation,
      would crowd together behind their protector, and shift their position as
      she advanced or retreated. This interesting scene continued for at least
      ten minutes, when the strength of the poor parent was observed to flag.
      The squirrel perceiving his advantage, became more daring, increased the
      frequency of his assaults, and would have gained an easy victory had not
      Mr. Bartram stepped forward from his hiding-place and drove him back to
      his hole, and thus rescued the innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species are usually abruptly pyriform, of a
      yellowish-buff ground-color, and are marked with blotches and spots of
      umber and sienna, which are collected chiefly about the greater extremity,
      where they are sometimes confluent. Occasionally, some specimens present a
      more elongated form, and others have the primary color of a yellowish-drab
      tint, with the markings of a deeper shade. The dimensions vary somewhat in
      a large collection from widely-separated localities. The largest measure
      1.41 by .99 of an inch, and the smallest 1.25 by .94. Considering the size
      of the bird, they seem to be out of all proportion.

      Plate XII.&mdash;SPIZELLA SOCIALIS, Bonaparte.&mdash;Chipping Sparrow.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Chipping
      Sparrow, so familiar to everybody, is not only one of the most abundant,
      but also one of the most widely diffused of all our species. It is found
      from the Atlantic to the Pacific in its two races, and breeds from Georgia
      to Nova Scotia on our eastern seaboard, and from Vera Cruz, Mexico,
      northward through Arizona, Utah and California. Although obtained at
      different seasons of the year in all portions of North America to Mexico,
      it is a strange and remarkable fact that its breeding-grounds are not
      equally extensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large numbers of these birds annually winter in the valley of the
      Colorado, and thence doubtless spread themselves over the whole Pacific
      region, as far north as Fort Resolution, on Great Slave Lake. In the East
      they may be seen in companies of a hundred or more from October to April
      through Northern Georgia and South Carolina, and possibly in the Gulf
      States.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the return of mild weather, which generally follows the vernal equinox,
      these flocks forsake in a measure their winter homes, and journey
      northward. Those from Northern Mexico pursue a northwesterly course,
      reaching Arizona about the twenty-fourth of March, where a part remain to
      breed; but the greater portion pass up the valley of the Colorado, and
      after receiving fresh accessions to their number, continue their migratory
      course until they have reached their destination. On the other hand, our
      Eastern variety tarries longer in the South, and only takes its departure
      when Nature, awakened from her winter sleep in our Northern States, has
      begun to put on her charming robe of green. But unlike its Western
      brother, it arrives in pairs, and never with the show and pomp of a large
      army. The tardiness of vegetation, and the paucity of insect life incident
      thereto, have doubtless much to do with the time and manner of its coming.
      In the Middle States this event happens during the last week of April, and
      in New England about the fifteenth, but the birds do not seem to become
      very abundant in the latter section until the beginning of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Field and Song Sparrows, near relatives, are much earlier comers, and
      are already in full song, making the groves and fields vocal with praises,
      long before the Chippy has made his appearance. But when the latter does
      arrive, we must look for his presence in our gardens and orchards, rather
      than along the borders of thickets, where he commends himself to our favor
      and esteem by his tameness and sociability. About our doorsides he loves
      to glean his fare, and when an opportunity offers, will often enter our
      houses during meal-times. So accustomed to man does the species become,
      that individuals have been known to present themselves regularly for food,
      as often as thrice a day, and even to accept the same from human hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The male is so absorbed in feeding during the first ten days of his stay
      that no attempt at singing is made. His only note then is a simple <i>chip</i>,
      indicative of unrest. This is slowly uttered, and at somewhat measured
      intervals. But later, he essays a song, and throughout the month of roses,
      his unpretending ditty, which consists of a repetition of the same sound,
      is kept up for hours together with scarce an intermission. Though poor his
      reputation as a singer, yet individuals have actually been known to sing,
      and very sweetly, too, but such cases are wholly exceptional, <i>et lusus
      naturae</i>. Mr. Flagg, in speaking of the male, says, "He seems to be the
      sentinel whom Nature has appointed to watch for the first glimmerings of
      dawn, which he always faithfully announces before any other bird is awake.
      Two or three strains from his octave pipe are the signal for a general
      awaking of the birds, and one by one they join the song, until the whole
      air resounds with an harmonious medley of voices." Again, says the same
      happy writer, "His continued trilling note is to the warbling band of
      morning musicians which may be heard before sunrise during May and June
      like the octave flute as heard in a grand concert of artificial
      instruments."
    </p>
    <p>
      The singing of the males is the inauguration of a new era in bird-life.
      The search for food no longer engrosses the attention as of yore, but the
      all-absorbing passion of love. The sexes cease their solitary wanderings.
      The females, moved by the touching appeals of the males, leave their
      native haunts, and join their masculine companions. All is now a scene of
      bustle and activity. The wooer and the wooed meet and lavish upon each
      other the most endearing attentions. Happiness reigns supreme. But the
      acme of felicity has not yet been reached. This is brought about by
      degrees, and is only perfectly attained when conjugal relationship is
      assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some parts of the country this important business is entered into as
      early as the fifteenth of May, but in others it is necessarily deferred
      until the succeeding month. The event is unattended by any peculiar
      demonstrations of joy, and is mostly celebrated in a matter-of-fact,
      businesslike way; the happy couple proceeding at once to an exploration of
      the surrounding scenery for a suitable place in which to build a home.
      This is a matter of little moment, as almost any small tree or low bush is
      available for the purpose. The nest is never placed on the ground, even in
      Arctic regions, where so many of our tree-builders vary from this custom
      to nidificate on the ground. In the vicinity of houses,' small trees,
      shrubbery and vines are utilized; but in pasture grounds, and on the
      borders of small thickets, the common red-cedar is chosen. Having selected
      a suitable site, both birds apply themselves to the task of building for a
      period of four or five days, when a neat and rather cosy structure is the
      result. Considerable variation is discernible in the architecture of
      different individuals. Some nests are rudely constructed, and rather loose
      and tenuous. Others have much of periphery, but little of thickness and
      internal depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical nest is hemispherical, neatly but loosely built, and possesses a
      cavity very symmetrical in contour. It is usually composed on the outside,
      except in rare cases, of fine rootlets, and is lined with black and white
      horse-hairs. In a beautiful domicile before us very few roots are
      noticeable, the bulk of the fabric being composed of horse-hairs, densely
      and compactly interwoven, and covered exteriorly with a few fine twigs and
      lint. Other nests before us are built entirely of fine rootlets. When such
      structures are found in bushes, and are well secured and protected by
      enveloping leaves and twigs, a curious anomaly often presents itself. A
      case of the kind came under our observation in August, 1876. Since that
      time others have been met with. It is where the nest, instead of occupying
      a nearly horizontal position, which is the natural one, is placed at an
      angle of inclination, and bears in the superior third a circular opening.
      What the object of this aperture can be, it is impossible to say, as the
      bird could never be surprised while on the nest. Possibly it was designed
      for the accommodation of the head of the owner while the process of
      incubation was going on; or, it may have been intended as a mode of
      ingress and egress, which opinion the position of the nest and its
      surroundings would seem to warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most curious and exceptional nests which we have ever seen, was
      obtained in the summer of 1870, in Northumberland Co., Pa. This nest was
      built upon a small bush, at an elevation of two feet above the ground.
      Externally, it is composed of dried plants, of an herbaceous character,
      with seed vessels intact. Internally, there is a slight lining of white
      horse-hairs. The diameter, on the outside, measures nearly four inches,
      and the thickness three and a half inches. The diameter of the cavity is
      three inches, and the depth nearly two. It is a magnificent structure,
      closely and compactly woven, and exactly hemispherical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing represents the usual style of nest. The position upon a branch
      of the red-cedar is one that is frequently chosen. The outside is mainly
      composed of fine roots of a reddish-brown color, and the inside of an
      equal mixture of white and black horse-hairs. The dimensions are as
      follows: External diameter, three inches; internal, two and a quarter
      inches; depth inside, three-fourths, and outside, one and an eighth
      inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest being finished, oviposition commences on the ensuing day, and
      proceeds at the rate of one egg daily, until the entire number is laid.
      This varies from three to five, even in the same locality. Incubation
      commences on the day after the last deposit has been made, and continues
      for a period of ten days. It is chiefly the duty of the female, although
      the male occasionally lends his assistance by taking the nest. When not
      thus occupied, he either polices the premises to guard against intrusion,
      or is away in search of food. When with young both birds become devoted
      parents, and evince the greatest anxiety and consternation when their nest
      is disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their actions at such times bespeak fear rather than courage. We have
      never known them to assume the threatening attitude which characterizes so
      many of our small species, nor seek to drive intruders away by sharp
      scoldings and angry gesticulations. But knowing that resistance would be
      useless, they quietly submit to circumstances, and repair to other scenes
      where they think to be secure from molestation and harm in carrying out
      the chief object of their being.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are fed at first on various larvæ, especially those of a
      lepidopterous character. To these, earth-worms, aphides, beetles and flies
      are added as condition and age require. When twelve days old they are
      persuaded to leave the nest, and, under the direction of the paternal
      sire, receive instruction in bird-lore. A period of eight or nine days
      more, and they earn their own living. They do not forsake their parents,
      however, but follow them into their old hunting-grounds, and thus help to
      constitute the small flocks which are generally observed in the fall of
      the year in our Eastern and Middle States, previous to migration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are oblong-oval in shape, and vary considerably in size. They are
      of a bluish-green color, and are sparingly spotted with umber and dark
      brown markings about the larger extremity. In some specimens, the latter
      are grouped after the fashion of a wreath, but this is the exception
      rather than the rule. The largest specimen we have ever seen measures .80
      by .57 of an inch; the smallest, .58 by .47. The average measurement is
      .72 of an inch in length, and .54 in breadth. The species as far as known
      is single-brooded.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Scarlet
      Taxager, a species but little known outside of the ornithological world,
      is more generally distributed than the casual observer is aware. According
      to various authorities, it ranges from Texas to Maine, and from South
      Carolina in a northwesterly direction to the southern limits of Lake
      Huron.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Eastern parts of Maine and Massachusetts it is but an occasional
      migrant; while in the western counties of the latter State, it is somewhat
      more plentiful, and nests in high, open woods and time-bewasted orchards.
      But it is in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia, and
      throughout the great Valley of the Mississippi, that the birds more
      especially abound and rear their young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few species are more susceptible to cold and sudden atmospheric changes
      than the subject of our sketch. As a necessary consequence it is by no
      means a very early comer. However fond it may be of the scenes of last
      year's labors and pleasures, it does not forsake the genial climate and
      perennial groves of its tropical American home, until balmy April has
      yielded her crown and sceptre to the lovely goddess of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      The male is usually the first to appear, the time of his arrival
      antedating that of his sombre-colored, less-favored companion by three or
      four days, although cases are cited where the sexes seemed to have
      performed the journey together.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time subsequent to his advent, the male is shy and suspicious,
      keeping away from the habitations of man, lest his brilliant suit of
      scarlet and black should excite the envy of some cruel and conscienceless
      collector, and he be summarily called upon, at the peril of his life, to
      part therewith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The female, on the contrary, less attractive in style and dress, has fewer
      human admirers, and is permitted to roam <i>ad libitum</i>, and with as
      much freedom and confidence as any of the little feathered creatures that
      crowd about our doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a change comes over the males after the lapse of a week or ten days.
      They may now be seen along our thoroughfares, and in our fields and
      gardens, acting with none of their former timidity, but endeavoring, by
      their beautiful plumage, agreeable manners, sweet song and useful service,
      to ingratiate themselves into the favor and esteem of their human
      brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus affairs continue for nearly a month, the sexes crossing and
      recrossing each other's paths in their many journeyings, and so intent
      upon the procurement of food, that the object of their mission is either
      entirely lost sight of, or else is held in check, for the nonce, by some
      strong impulse of their being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Events, however, are ripening for a speedy fulfilment of the business that
      has called them hither. The males exhibit less anxiety about
      food-questions, and a positive distaste for the unsettled and lonely lives
      which they have been leading. A similar feeling, but less conspicuously
      manifested, pervades and animates the gentler sexes, if outward actions
      afford proper criteria for judging of internal emotions. But exceedingly
      more coy than their imperial lords, they keep at a respectable distance,
      preferring to be wooed and won, rather than assume any other <i>role</i>
      in the drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duty of taking the initiative step falls to the lot of the male. In
      order to accomplish this purpose more effectively, perhaps, as he thinks,
      he seeks the tall tree-tops, and for many a long and weary hour, thrills
      the ambient air with his sweetest music. We have seen many a venturesome
      fellow, seemingly unconscious of his surroundings, and wholly absorbed in
      his voluntarily-imposed task, take his station upon a lofty tree by the
      road-side, in full view of passers-by, and pour forth his harmonious
      utterances with all the animation and pathos of his being. Tired at last,
      he ceases his efforts, preens his feathers, and is off to try his fortunes
      elsewhere. Thus he keeps up these movements, with necessary intermissions
      of rest and recreation, during the livelong day, until his song has
      arrested the attention of some impressible female. This ditty, which is
      uttered in a low and pensive manner, and which may be rather accurately
      represented by the syllables <i>chi-chi-chi-char-ee-char-ee-chi</i>, has
      been likened to the well-known notes of the Baltimore Oriole, but we are
      unable to trace the least resemblance thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      His efforts being finally crowned with success, the happy lover is profuse
      in his attentions and caresses, and leads his willing bride to other
      scenes, where they spend a brief season of enjoyment, before entering into
      preparations for establishing a home. As they move through the branches
      and foliage together, they utter their affection in a low whispering
      warble, and in tones of singular sweetness and tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having celebrated their nuptials, they settle down to the duties of
      nest-building in earnest. The selection of a site is the first thing that
      commands attention. This is a matter of no little importance, and one that
      requires the exercise of considerable judgment. Both birds generally go
      together 011 this essential business, and carefully ransack the fields and
      thickets until a location is obtained which is wholly eligible. Nothing
      occurs in these examinations, if we are to judge from the behavior of the
      participants therein, to give offence, or mar the happiness of the wedded
      pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The places selected vary according to latitude and the fancy of the
      builders. Orchards, and groves of chestnuts, oaks, and nut-trees are
      frequented, and often a preference is manifested for swampy woods if not
      too dense. In places contiguous to human habitations the builders,
      especially the male, act with less carefulness than in more retired
      localities. They are here more secure from the depredations of rapacious
      birds, the latter having a decided aversion to man, their inveterate and
      merciless foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building operations are usually begun about the fifteenth of May in the
      latitude of Philadelphia, towards the close of the month in New England,
      but never later than the first or second week of June. In its southern
      breeding-quarters, following the examples of its more distant relatives,
      it doubtless nests earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest is placed upon the horizontal branch of a fruit-tree, usually on
      the edge of a wood, but occasionally in an orchard. Sometimes it is built
      over a crotch, which constitutes a more stable position. When a nest is
      located on the outskirts of a thicket, some species of oak, or the
      tulip-tree, is generally selected as the recipient thereof. In an orchard,
      the apple claims and receives this honor. Its height above the ground is
      mostly from fifteen to twenty feet in sequestered situations, but in
      cultivated districts, a much lower elevation is chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The labor of building is performed mainly by the female, her partner
      lending but little assistance. The time devoted to the task seldom exceeds
      a period of four days, and so loosely are the fabrics put together, in the
      majority of cases, that they scarcely survive the season for which they
      were intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      A structure before us is rather symmetrical and neatly built for the
      species, and quite shallow. Externally, it is composed of dried twigs,
      weeds and grasses, variously intermingled. Internally, there is a lining
      of fine roots, grass-stems, and the inner bark of the chestnut and oak.
      The outside diameter is five and a half inches, height two inches,
      diameter of cavity three and a half inches, and depth about half an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nuttall describes a nest examined by him as composed of rigid stalks
      of weeds and slender fir-twigs joined together with narrow strips of
      apocynum and pea-vine runners, and wound around with thin wiry stalks of
      the helianthemum, the whole so loosely and thinly plaited as to admit the
      light quite readily through the interstices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Plate represents the average structure. On examination it will be
      found to be nearly circular above, although somewhat irregular towards the
      lower two-thirds. The hase is rather loosely constructed of strips of
      bark, fine stems of vegetables with dried flowers attached, and rootlets
      of woody plants. Upon this as a basis is wrought, with more compactness
      and finish, a framework, which is beautifully lined with reddish-brown
      stems of herbaceous plants, and fine strips of inner bark. The external
      diameter is five inches, and the height, two inches. The diameter of the
      cavity is three inches, and the depth one-half of an inch. This nest is
      shown in its natural position over and partly between a forked branch of
      one of our common species of oak. The female bird is placed upon the
      right, as though about to assume the duty of incubation; while her
      illustrious partner occupies a very dignified position on the left of the
      picture. All the figures, however, are reduced one-third, so as to bring
      them within the scope of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having completed her home, the female almost immediately commences to
      deposit her complement of four or five eggs, at the rate of one a day, in
      as many consecutive days. This business being attended to, on the day
      succeeding the last extrusion, she takes the nest, and for a period of
      twelve or thirteen days of rather close sitting, supplies the warmth
      necessary to develop her house-full of children.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a remarkable fact, and one that beautifully displays the wonderful
      wisdom which is taught by Nature, that the brilliantly-colored males
      studiously avoid the nest, and only approach it, when necessary, with
      caution and stealth, for fear of betraying its presence; while the
      females, with their plain coloring in harmony with the surrounding
      foliage, sit thereon, and care for their helpless offspring without danger
      of molestation. But if the nest is approached with hostile intention, or
      is actually invaded, the males emerge from their places of concealment,
      and assist in carrying its precious treasures away. But how this is
      accomplished, it is impossible to say. Mr. Minot has known instances where
      the young have been removed, although many of the cases seemed to be
      beyond the ability of bird-ingenuity to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion, while our worthy friend was ascending a tree which
      contained a nest of this species, and that, too, with as much care and
      quietness as was possible under the circumstances, he was surprised to see
      the parent birds return several times to the tree upon his arrival at a
      point which commanded full view of the inside of the domicile. Although
      the nest was known to contain eggs, which were seen through the
      interstices from below, his astonishment was undoubtedly heightened, when
      he discovered it to be empty. He immediately began an examination of the
      premises, but could find no pieces of broken shells, or traces of yolk on
      branch, or on the ground beneath. The eggs had certainly been spirited
      away, but whether they were afterwards returned and successfully hatched
      or not, he was unable to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the precaution which these birds take in the selection of
      a building-spot, and the artfulness with which they seek to conceal their
      home by means of the surrounding leaves, it is a fact, not generally
      known, but nevertheless true, that much of their prudence and painstaking
      counts for naught. They may deceive the trained collector, but they cannot
      elude the sagacity and watchfulness of the female Cowbird, who is ever on
      the alert and ready to slip into their unoccupied nest and deposit her own
      egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have known instances where as many as three of these parasitic eggs had
      been left in the nest alongside of one of the rightful occupant's eggs. A
      case of the kind came to notice last summer. But whether the owners of the
      nest would have hatched the intruders or not, we cannot say, as its
      contents were rifled shortly after the discovery had been made. Owing to
      its shallowness, it is highly probable that the owners would have thrown
      them out on becoming cognizant of their presence. With small birds, and
      also with those which are in the habit of building deep nests, there is
      considerable difficulty attending such an attempt. The birds are generally
      obliged to submit to circumstances, and hatch the aliens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The food of the young is chiefly collected by the mother-bird, and
      consists of the larvæ of beetles, various species of lepidoptera with
      mature forms of the same, spiders, plant-lice, diptera and earthworms.
      These are fed to them for the space of a fortnight subsequent to their
      leaving the eggs, when they quit for the first time the close precincts of
      their shallow home, to receive their earliest impressions of the outside
      world, or to take some lessons in the secrets of bird-lore. Another week
      more, and they are thrown upon the cold and pitiless world to fight their
      way as others have done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devotion of the parent to her young is shown not only in the assiduity
      with which she labors to supply them with the essential articles of diet,
      but also in the distress which she manifests when they are in perilous
      situations, and in her efforts to extricate them from the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson relates a very touching instance of such devotion. Having taken a
      very young bird from the nest, he carried it to his friend, Mr. Bartram.
      The latter gentleman placed it in a cage, which he suspended near a nest
      containing young Orioles, in hopes that the parents of these birds would
      be moved to feed it. This they failed to do. Its cries, however, attracted
      its own parent, who diligently attended it, and supplied it with food for
      several days. At length she became so solicitous for its liberation, as
      evidenced by repeated cries of entreaty, that Mr. Bartram could bear it no
      longer. He immediately mounted to the cage, took out the captive, and
      restored it to its parents, who accompanied it to the woods with notes of
      great exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in August the male begins to moult, when, after a little, he appears
      in the greenish livery of the female. In this stage he is not
      distinguishable from her or his young family. Now is the time for
      departure, and parents and young forsake with many regrets the land where
      they have experienced so much real happiness, for the sunny groves of
      Mexico and Peru, or the breezy forests of their West Indian home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species vary from an inch to .90 in length, and have an
      average width of .65. The ground-color passes from a well-marked shade of
      greenish-blue to a dull white with scarcely the faintest tinge of blue. In
      some the spots differ in size, are more or less confluent, and chiefly of
      a reddish-brown color intermingled with a few others of an obscure purple.
      As a rule, there is a notable resemblance to each other, in the eggs of
      the same nest-complement, except where, by reason of pillage, or some
      adventitious circumstance, the female is called upon to deposit, after she
      has already furnished the necessary number, in order to compensate for
      those that have been taken or destroyed. It may be the earliest-laid eggs
      that have escaped the avaricious oologist. In that event, the additional
      ones must necessarily be lighter in colors, and contrast very strongly
      with those which remain. Locality has doubtless much to do with
      color-variations, southern specimens being more sharply defined than those
      from colder latitudes.

      Plate XIV.&mdash;HIRUNDO HORREORUM, Barton.&mdash;Barn Swallow.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Barn Swallow,
      the chief of its fellows, is the most widely diffused, most generally
      abundant, and, wherever found, the best known of all our species. None are
      more universally or deservedly popular.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ranges throughout North America from Florida to Greenland, and from the
      Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, breeding, strange to say, over nearly the
      whole of this vast territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is its attachment to last year's scenes and associations, that it
      leaves its far-off home in the sunny South rather early, gathering its
      forces from the plains of Brazil, the spicy isles of the Indies, and the
      lofty plateau of Mexico, and wends its graceful flight northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike many of its kin, this familiar little species does not wait until
      the soft mild days of May have visited the earth, but, actuated by an
      overmastering instinct to revisit the land of its nativity, it comes ere
      the dying throes of the winter-demon have ceased to be heard in the wild
      March winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the more genial fields and streams of our Southern border-states first
      invite its presence, and offer it an abiding-place, until its more
      northern habitats are made to rejoice under the influence of the sun-god.
      In the Central section of this great land of ours, this generally occurs
      during the early days of balmy April, when spring may be said to commence
      in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hundreds of these agile creatures, carried away by the exuberance of their
      feelings, may now be seen either disporting themselves in the atmosphere,
      or more profitably engaged in pursuing their multifarious prey on swift
      and noiseless wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      While some remain in these parts to breed, others retire further north,
      and take up their quarters in old accustomed haunts; reaching New York and
      Southern New England towards the close of April, and the more northern
      portions of the latter section about the first of May. Continuing their
      migration, a few, according to Sir John Richardson, pass on until they
      have attained the latitude of 67° 31', where they stop to breed. This
      doubtless occurs about the last of May, or the beginning of June, if the
      fact of their nesting at Fort Chippewayan, ten degrees further south, on
      the fifteenth of May, affords any basis for computation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Pacific coast these birds are less abundant than 011 our Eastern
      shores. This is attributable to the lack or scarcity of suitable
      building-places. As settlements multiply, they increase in numbers,
      especially in the neighborhood of farms. Farther inland, the species is
      conspicuous for its rarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of its arrival until its departure about the first of
      September, and even during the breeding-period, this Swallow delights in
      society. When foraging for food, it is not unusual to see varying numbers
      of birds engaged in the same useful occupation. This habit of
      gregariousness, which evinces a love for the companionship of its kind,
      instead of dying out, as is generally the case with many species that
      might be cited, continues to exist, and manifests itself during the time
      of nesting by a desire to dwell in communities. But this is not everywhere
      the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some parts of the country, particularly in the extreme north, the sexes
      appear to come together only upon arrival at their places of destination.
      Mating commences either while the birds are in transit, or immediately
      upon the conclusion thereof; and as nesting commences when they have
      reached the end of their journey, it is reasonable to conclude that the
      two follow each other in close succession, leaving no time for the display
      of those curious antics so characteristic of the feathered creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in lower latitudes, the first two or three weeks after the arrival of
      these birds, is spent in the procurement of food. The good which is then
      accomplished, cannot be fully appreciated, and is of such immense value as
      to gain for the species the high position which it occupies in the
      affections of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole of this time, we have seen nothing that would appear to
      indicate that courtship is indulged in. Perhaps this necessary business of
      bird-life is practised in mid-air, while the sexes are skimming through
      the swaying fluid, or circling in joyous company high overhead. May not
      the pleasing, lively succession of twitterings which drop earthward, when
      these lovely creatures are careering towards the dome of heaven, he the
      love-songs which the males are pouring into the ears of listening females?
      To be fully appreciated, they should be heard during these exciting aerial
      movements. When perching, the birds seem less animated; consequently, the
      music is slower, but none the less agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether this business is in vogue or not among these birds, matters
      little, so long as the important duty which has brought them hither is
      accomplished. That this is the case, is indisputable, as the sexes are
      known to separate from the flocks, and repair to accustomed haunts to
      build.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period of nesting varies somewhat according to latitude and the
      conditions of the weather. In the West, nests have been found with eggs as
      early as the thirtieth of April, but this was in the vicinity of San
      Francisco. In semi-tropical regions, it is reasonable to look for an early
      assumption of matrimonial relations. But in the generality of instances,
      outside of our warm Southern latitudes, the birds commence to build their
      domiciles from the fifteenth to the last of May, and, in some cases, even
      running into the first week of the month that follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the construction of a home, which is usually the work of six days, the
      builders apply themselves with persevering assiduity, only stopping from
      their labors, for brief spells of time, in order to rest, or to procure
      the essential articles of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      The places selected for this purpose are strange and various. In the wild
      districts of the West, the birds nidificate in caves that abound in the
      bluffs along the sea-shore. Near Fort Dallas, Oregon, the basaltic cliffs
      so common thereabouts are utilized. In the vicinity of Pyramid Lake,
      Nevada, their nests are placed among the "tufa domes" attached to the
      roofs of caves, seldom more than one or two pairs being found together. In
      other localities, in the same section of country, limestone cliffs,
      crevices of rocks, and sides of wooden bridges, serve the same purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming East, where they are much more familiar and confiding, we find
      quite a change in this particular. Venturing into our crowded cities, they
      often build their elaborate homes in the porches of dwellings. But the
      various farm-buildings, which are noticeable in agricultural regions, are
      generally to be preferred. In such places, the nests are erected on
      horizontal rafters, or secured to the frameworks, underneath the eaves,
      after the fashion of the Cliff Swallow's nest. Again, bridges and
      dilapidated spring-houses are occasionally pressed into service. Besides
      the foregoing, cases have been cited where the nest of the Cliff Swallow
      was used, and also one where a small building, of very rude structure&mdash;which
      was temporarily occupied as a blacksmith-shop&mdash;was utilized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their natural breeding-places, before the settlement of this country, were
      caves, overhanging cliffs, and like situations. Swallow Cave, at Nahant,
      was formerly a favorite place of resort. As the country becomes. settled,
      these places are forsaken for the more convenient ones which the buildings
      of the farm afford. Such accommodations, experience has shown, tend to a
      rapid increase in their numbers, for the birds are not slow to perceive
      the advantages which result from a close familiarity with man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nests are constructed of separate layers of mud, from ten to twelve in
      number, which are often, though not always, parted by strata of fine
      grasses. The layers themselves are formed of small pellets composed of
      clay and fine sand, worked over by the birds, and which are adjusted side
      by side until each layer is complete. The walls being finished, the
      circumscribed cavity is stuffed with fine soft grass, and is warmly lined
      with downy feathers. The average height and breadth of such structures
      when placed on the horizontal rafters of barns is about five inches. The
      cavity is usually three inches wide at the rim&mdash;thus making the
      thickness of the walls an inch&mdash;and about two inches in depth. When
      placed against the side of a house or of a barn, a strong foundation of
      mud is usually built, upon which the nest is reared. In that event, the
      nest is more compactly made, and varies from the preceding, by its more
      elongate form.
    </p>
    <p>
      A striking peculiarity of many of these fabrics, is an additional platform
      which is placed against the nest proper, but wholly distinct therefrom.
      This is undoubtedly designed as a roosting-place, and is used during the
      incubating period by the one or the other parent at night, or when not
      occupied in the procurement of food, or by both when the young have
      complete possession thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nest before us which was built upon a horizontal rafter underneath an
      overshoot, and which may be regarded as typical in the ordinary scientific
      sense, is composed externally of ten semi-elliptical series of mud
      pellets, slightly overlapping each other after the manner of tiles, and
      intercalated with the stems and blades of fine grasses. Similar vegetable
      materials are found in small quantities on the outside, which serve to
      strengthen the pellets, thus acting as substantial girders to the entire
      structure. On the inside is a small layer of the stems of our common
      timothy grass, which is followed by another of greater compactness, and,
      finally, by a lining of soft meadow grass. The entire length of this nest
      is four inches, and it gradually tapers from above downwards, giving the
      appearance of a longitudinal section of an inverted cone. The depression
      is two and a half inches wide in one direction, about four in the line of
      greatest width, and scarcely an inch in depth, the shallowness being
      compensated for by the greater length transversally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Plate represents a nest which is nearly the exact counterpart of the
      one just described, differing immaterially therefrom in the lack of
      grasses between the layers of mud on the outside, and in having a lining
      of feathers. The dimensions are about the same in the original, but have
      been somewhat reduced in the cut, owing to the size of the page. The
      female is shown upon the edge of the nest, peering therein, while her
      stronger half is on the wing, and evidently homeward-bound. In the natural
      position this elaborate structure was completely protected by the eaves of
      the building against which it reposed, but in order to show the inner
      arrangement, as well as the eggs <i>in situ</i>, the artist was compelled
      to leave it partially exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest being completed, two or three days elapse before the female is
      ready to deposit her first egg. Having commenced, she continues to do so,
      at the rate of one a day, until her full number is laid, which, according
      to what shall constitute her complement, requires from four to six days.
      Incubation immediately succeeds, and lasts for eleven days. This is not
      exclusively the work of the female. Sometimes her affectionate husband
      relieves her for awhile. But when not thus employed, he occupies his spare
      moments either in fetching her some dainty article of meat, or in guarding
      his home from intrusion. Few species show less dread of man during these
      times. Such is the confidence which is reposed in him, that the
      sitting-bird will keep to the nest, and allow him to pass within a few
      feet of her. But, on the other hand, if any interference is attempted, she
      glides noiselessly out, and watches and contemplates his movements with
      few, if any, murmurs of complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting account is given of these birds by Mr. J. K. Lord. While he
      and his party were encamped at Schyakwateen, in British Columbia, a small
      shanty, loosely constructed of poles, and tightly roofed, was erected, and
      used as a blacksmith's shop. Early one morning, late in June, they were
      visited by a pair of Swallows, who instantly perched on the roof of this
      shed, unmindful of the noise of the bellows, or the showers of sparks that
      flew around. Presently they entered the house, and commenced an
      examination of the roof and its supporting poles, twittering to each other
      the while, in the most animated manner. At length the matter appeared to
      be settled, and on the ensuing day they commenced the erection of a
      building on one of the poles directly over the anvil. Though the hammer
      was constantly passing close to the structure, yet the fearless builders
      kept steadily at work, and in about three days had completed the rough
      outline thereof. A few days more, and their home was ready for occupancy.
      The narrator often stationed himself upon a log to watch them, with his
      face so near, that their feathers frequently brushed against it as they
      toiled at their task. Suffice it to say, the eggs were laid, the young
      hatched and successfully reared, and the trustful pair maintained their
      serenity and fearlessness till the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attentions of the parents to their young are unremitting. The number
      of small insects which they collect for them is almost incredible. Flies,
      aquatic larvæ, and small moths form a considerable part of their earliest
      diet. But as they become older, other insects are added to their bill of
      fare. When about fourteen days old they are able to leave the nest. The
      manouvres of the parents to entice them out, and the assistance which they
      render them in their first feeble attempts at flight, are among the most
      curious and interesting of all our ornithological experiences. A few days'
      training gives them complete control over their alar appendages, and they
      are soon as merry and happy as any of their older companions, as they sail
      through the air in quest of insects, or in the pursuit of pleasure. By the
      first of September, they are strong enough to endure the fatigue incident
      to the long journey which they are called upon to make, in obedience to
      the supreme law of their being, at this season of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species are white with a roseate tinge in unblown
      specimens, and are marked with spots of reddish and purplish brown,
      varying in size and number, but chiefly collected about the larger end.
      From the Cliff Swallow's eggs, they differ in having finer spots, and in
      being smaller and rather more elongated. Specimens from different
      localities, and even in this region, show marked variations in length,
      some being .95 of an inch, and others; not more than .74. The same bolds
      good with respect to the width; the greatest being .63 of an inch, and the
      least .50. The average dimensions are .77 by .55 of an inch. The number of
      broods generally raised is two, the latter often as late as the last of
      July, or the beginning of August. This is not always the case, especially
      when the season has been unusually delayed by means of the weather, or
      when the natural instinct has been unaccountably restrained.

    <h2>
      Plate XV.&mdash;LOPHORTYX CALIFORNICA, Bonaparte.&mdash;The Valley Quail
      of California.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Valley Quail&mdash;so
      called in contradistinction to the Plumed or Mountain Quail, which
      inhabits hills and highlands&mdash;has an exceedingly limited range. It
      abounds in all the valleys of California and Oregon, both inland and
      maritime, but never in the forest-depths, nor on the mountain-tops, nor in
      the interior basin where there is a dearth of water and vegetation. In the
      spring of 1857 these birds were introduced into Washington Territory, on
      the grassy plains near Puget Sound, where they soon established
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Dr. Cones, who has paid special attention to the distribution
      of our birds, the present species ranges from the Columbia River to Cape
      St. Lucas. In California it is chiefly restricted to the country west of
      the Sierra Nevada, which, with the Great Colorado Desert, is said to
      constitute an apparently impassable barrier between it and Gambel's
      Partridge&mdash;a very near relative. Up the mountains a higher elevation
      than three or four thousand feet is never known to be attained, the region
      beyond being occupied by the Mountain Quail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prairies and grain-fields, and thickets along the borders of streams, are
      noted places of resort. Coveys of from a dozen to a hundred or more
      individuals may be seen in such places, during the non-breeding season,
      busily employed in gleaning, or in some sort of diversion. Although
      comparatively tame, and permitting a very near approach, yet when
      disturbed, they betake themselves to the bushes or trees. When to the
      latter, they squat so closely along the branches, as to escape the keen
      sight of pursuers. It will not lie to a dog, as our Eastern species is
      wont to do, but runs until driven to seek safety in flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout California these birds are often domesticated, and made to
      consort with the common barnyard fowl. A similar practice might be tried
      in the East with happy results. That it would succeed, there can be no
      reasonable doubt. A few years ago, an attempt was made to introduce them
      into Long Island, which was only partially successful. But the demands of
      New York epicures soon led to their extermination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The season of flocking being over, which continues from the first of
      September until about the middle of May, as nearly as we can ascertain,
      the coveys break up into pairs, and mating is about to commence. This
      important event is heralded by certain peculiar cries which the male-birds
      emit while sitting upon a stump or prostrate log in the midst of the
      surrounding verdure. These notes are very strange, and may be likened to
      the harsh and disagreeable tones of some of the Woodpeckers. "They may be
      aptly represented," says Dr. Newberry, "by the syllables <i>kûck-kuck-kûck-kâ</i>,
      the first three notes being rapidly repeated, the last prolonged with a
      falling inflection."
    </p>
    <p>
      Language can hardly describe the actions of the males during these times.
      While some may be seen strutting along some fallen log, or gesticulating
      overhead on the motionless tree-branches, others, less lofty in their
      aspirations, move with dignified demeanor in and out the bushes,
      untrammeled by interlacing grasses. All, however, seem animated by one
      common impulse&mdash;the admiration and favor of birds less beautiful,
      perhaps, but more modest, than themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a charming sight, and one ever to be remembered, to watch these
      enamored birds as they press their several suits. The stately tread, erect
      but comely carriage, waving plumes, quivering wings, and flashing eyes,
      bespeak the proud consciousness of superior worth and vigor. The beautiful
      bird glances defiantly about him, and challenges loudly for a rival.
      Again, he throws down the gauntlet, but none appears to take it up. He may
      now retire; his rights are proven.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hid away in leafy bower, a gentler being watches his movements,
      admires his bearing, and fascinated by the courage she sees displayed,
      hopes that the next movement may bring him to her side, but dreading lest
      it may. At length their eyes meet, she trembles and attempts to fly, but
      cannot. Another look; he reads the secret of her heart, and with one loud,
      exultant cry, flies straight to her, curtsies low, and with wing
      half-spread above her, whispers softly in her ear the story of his love.
      She listens, but draws away. He pleads once more. She stands irresolute.
      Again he makes the attempt. This time with all the eloquence of his being.
      He conquers, and what a joy is his!
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial over, the prize secured, the delighted lover, proud of his
      bride, showers upon her the rich fruitage of his love, guards her with
      jealous care, and seeks by every means in his power to add to her comfort
      and happiness. A few days thus spent, and the wedded couple, conscious of
      the sense of responsibility which attaches to them, cast about for a
      suitable spot for a home. They search through the tall, rank herbage,
      among piles of driftwood that lie scattered about, under fallen cacti, or
      in the shadow of jasmine bushes, and at length make up their minds. Where
      none of these are to be found, they do not hesitate to take to an open
      field. Little more is needed than to fix upon a spot, for the nest is far
      from an elaborate affair, being aught else than a collection of loose, dry
      grasses arranged without much care. In many instances, even these articles
      are dispensed with. The Plate represents the ordinary style of nest,
      containing a set of thirteen eggs drawn to the natural size. On the left
      of the picture may be seen the male, which differs from the female in his
      more brilliant and vivid colors, both being placed in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished her simple domicile, or rather having chosen a spot, for
      laying&mdash;for in the generality of cases no nest whatever is made&mdash;the
      female deposits day after day the eggs which are to constitute her
      complement. These are said to be from twelve to sixteen in number. When
      not pressed to lay, she rambles about with her lord, in close company,
      until compelled to take the nest. She now abandons all recreation, becomes
      sober and maternal, and sets about her duty in earnest. But she is not
      forgotten because she cannot enter into his idle amusements. Mounted upon
      some bush or log which projects above the nest, he stands watch, or
      solaces her weary moments with his best music. This ditty, though far from
      being harmonious, is presumably satisfactory to the one concerned. The
      time spent in incubation lasts for two weeks or more, until feeble cries
      are heard from the nest. The mother-bird now dries and cuddles the queer
      little beings, and the happy parents soon lead them off in quest of food.
      When the young are disturbed by human foes, the male-bird utters a sharp
      <i>pit</i>, resembling the common note of the Cardinal Grosbeak, which is
      doubtless the signal for flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this Quail differ somewhat in size, and also in ornamentation.
      The ground-color is usually a creamy-white. The markings sometimes occur
      in the form of freckles, at other times in large scattered spots, and
      frequently in the form of confluent blotches. Their colors pass from a
      uniform shading of olivaceous-drab, through a rusty-drab, into a
      chestnut-brown. All the specimens that we have seen are sharply defined at
      one extremity and rounded at the other. In a set of fourteen eggs before
      us, the largest measures 1.32 by 1.00 inches; the smallest 1.13 in length
      and .97 in breadth. The average size is 1.23 by .98 inches. From the
      number of eggs sometimes found in a nest, it becomes a question whether
      birds, severely pressed, may not sometimes lay in nests not their own. We
      have no positive information that this does happen, but observation
      renders it highly probable that such is the case with the Virginia Quail,
      and, also, with some other birds. But however this may be, it is tolerably
      certain that broods of young sometimes coalesce after hatching. It has
      even been inferred that several females belong to one male, and with their
      varying broods run together.

      Plate XVI.&mdash;REGULUS SATRAPA, Licht.&mdash;Golden-crowned Kinglet.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Golden-crowned
      Kinglet, or Wren, ranges over nearly the entire continent of North
      America, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, and northward from Texas
      and New Mexico to Sitka on the west, where it seems to replace the
      Ruby-crown. On our eastern seaboard it doubtless attains as high a
      latitude. Audubon claims to having found it nesting in Newfoundland, and
      Baedecker, in Labrador, but recent travelers have certainly not
      encountered its presence during the breeding-period in those parts, since
      they have left no record of such occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the United States, until recently, it was generally supposed to be a
      migrant; arriving pretty punctually in October, just as autumn is merging
      into winter, and remaining till May. But the past five or six years have
      let in new light upon its history, and shown, what had already been
      surmised, that it would be found to breed in the coniferous forests, and
      mountainous regions toward our northern border.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our knowledge of the species is limited, and is mainly restricted to its
      habits during its long stay with us from October to May. Every one who has
      left the shadow of home, and strayed out into the fields and woods, or
      along the margins of ice-bound streams and ponds, must have had his
      attention directed to its cries as it flitted from tree to tree in search
      of food. At such times, the sexes remain apart, or but occasionally come
      together. Although shunning, rather than courting each other's society,
      their casual meeting is not the harbinger of contention, but is either
      tacitly acknowledged, or passed by unnoticed. While there seems to be an
      indisposition to mingle, yet evidence is not wanting to show that society
      of some kind is not wholly disagreeable. Either sex manifests, or seems to
      manifest, some regard for the Black-capped Titmouse. Wherever you discover
      the one, you are pretty sure to find the other. This occurrence does not
      appear to be accidental, but rather to be dictated by a desire for
      company, or by actual necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although evincing a decided partiality for Nature in her wildness, on
      warm, sunshiny days in mid-winter our little friend may frequently be seen
      climbing about our trees after the fashion of a Creeper, or standing
      beside our doors in anxious expectation of receiving his share of crumbs
      from the table. He is now the very impersonation of fearlessness, and
      conducts himself with all the familiarity of a long-tried friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as spring returns, a peculiar cry greets the ear, louder and more
      frequent than usual. <i>Tsi-tsi-tsi</i> comes from wood and glen, from
      stream and hollow. Once heard, these syllables can never be forgotten, for
      they are uttered in a running, pleasing rhythm, and with a gently-rising
      intonation, and seem indicative of joy and satisfaction. But as the season
      for departure arrives, these sounds give place to others of a more
      agreeable character. Even in the heart of winter this music may be heard.
      Perhaps some precious reminiscence of the past has arisen in the memory to
      evoke this flood of song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of expectancy and unrest, about the middle of May&mdash;often
      earlier, seldom later&mdash;the little Golden-crown wings its flight to
      other scenes. Of the exact time, we know nothing. It does not stop to bid
      us an affectionate adieu, but is gone before we are hardly aware of the
      blank which it has left. Its return is as unheralded and mysterious.
      To-day we admire its graceful actions, sprightly ditty and beautiful
      plumage. To-morrow we search the old haunts, feeling almost confident that
      it must be lurking somewhere about, but to be doomed to disappointment.
      Occasionally our patience is rewarded by finding a couple of individuals,
      who have either lost their reckoning, or have made up their minds to spend
      the summer at home. But the most of their fellows still follow the path
      which their ancestors have so long trodden.
    </p>
    <p>
      While some follow the stretch of country between our two great western
      mountain systems, and breed in Washington Territory and the country to the
      northward, others forsake their winter-quarters, and travel in a
      northeasterly direction to the shores of Newfoundland and Labrador. A few,
      however, lag behind and find suitable summer resorts in the pine forests
      and Thuja swamps of New Hampshire and Maine. When our mountain regions and
      dense forests are better known, we hazard the opinion that many will be
      found to breed nearer home than we are aware. Paired individuals have
      often been met with along the hills of the Wissahickon, in Pennsylvania,
      during the breeding-season, which evidently had nests, but diligent search
      failed to reveal the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the discovery of the nest of this species, the presumption was that
      it built a pensile nest, not unlike the European congener, and that it
      laid small eggs faintly sprinkled with buff-colored dots on a white
      background, but differing little in size from those of the common
      Humming-bird. It was also inferred that two broods were annually raised,
      from the fact that so much time was spent in its summer abode, and also
      because full-fledged young were found by Mr. Nuttall in May, on the
      Columbia, and in August, by Mr. Audubon, in Labrador.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Mr. J. K. Lord, who discovered this species to be very common
      in Vancouver's Island, and also along the entire boundary-line of
      Washington Territory and British Columbia, where it sometimes reaches an
      elevation of six thousand feet, it constructs a pensile nest, which it
      suspends from the extreme end of a pine-branch; and that it lays from five
      to seven eggs. The materials of the nest, and the color and dimensions of
      the eggs, were never described.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world remained in ignorance of these matters until the summer of 1875,
      when Mr. H. D. Minot discovered, on the sixteenth day of July, a nest of
      this species. It was built in a forest of the White Mountains, which
      consisted chiefly of white birches and evergreens. The nest was securely
      fastened to the twigs of a spreading hemlock-bough, was globular in shape,
      and placed about four feet above the ground. The outside was composed of
      hanging moss and bits of dead leaves; the inside was chiefly lined with
      feathers. There can be no doubt as to the authenticity of this nest, as
      Mr. Minot observed the parents in the act of carrying food to their young,
      and was enabled to track them to their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the structure from which the drawing was made&mdash;found near Bangor,
      Maine&mdash;was presented to Mr. Harry Merrill, in the summer of 1876. It
      was placed about six feet from the ground in a mass of thick growth so
      peculiar to many of our fir trees, and is chiefly composed of moss on the
      outside, with a few small fragments of chips, and is lined with hair and
      feathers, the latter principally. The external diameter is four and a half
      inches, and depth outside nearly three inches. The opening is at the top,
      and measures about one and three-fourths inches across, and two in depth.
      Although the birds that built this nest were not seen by Mr. Merrill, yet
      by the pretty sure evidence of exclusion, they cannot belong to any other
      species than the one under consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of their habits while with young, our knowledge is small. It is evident,
      however, from what Mr. Minot says, that both parents supply their
      nestlings with food. Incubation is doubtless performed by them both, the
      female assuming the bulk of the labor. Unlike many species, these birds do
      not pass the breeding-season in silence, but keep up, with occasional
      intermissions, an animated twittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs possibly range from six to ten in number. To the eye they appear
      of a cream-white color, apparently covered with minute spots. Under the
      microscope, the ground-color is white, with shell marks of purplish-slate,
      and a few obscure spots of a deep buff, rather superficial, to which their
      dirty tinge is probably due. The largest egg measures .52 of an inch in
      length, and .40 in width; the smallest, .47 by .30 inches. The average
      dimensions of the ten eggs are .50 by .41 inches.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Razor-billed
      Auc, owing to its boreal residence, is not so well known as many other
      marine species which breed nearer home. Like its few intimate cousins, it
      is chiefly restricted to Arctic regions, only coming southward when
      pressed by severe weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though apparently the best known of its family, yet many of the details of
      its habits are lacking to render its biography anything like complete. Of
      its area of distribution we are tolerably well-informed. In the
      north-eastern portions of North America, particularly along the
      sea-borders of Labrador and Newfoundland, it is quite plentiful, and
      thence occasionally strays along the coast-lines of New England and the
      Middle States during the winter. These birds, however, are not confined to
      this continent, but are identical with the bird of the northern regions of
      the Old World.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Mr. Cory, who has studied them in their haunts, they are
      remarkably abundant and prolific on some of the Magdalen Islands, Bird
      Rock and Byron Island especially, where the young birds were observed in
      their downy robes of black and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visiting the United States only in small numbers during the inclemency of
      winter, its predilection for the northern homes of its fathers&mdash;when
      the mild breath of spring in its upward march from the South has tempered
      with mercy the reign of old Boreas in his rocky, ice-bound fastnesses&mdash;induces
      it to take its departure, and wend its longing flight thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is not the slightest evidence, so far as our investigations have
      extended, to show that any attempts have ever been made to nest along the
      shores of this country. The fact that the species breeds on the islands in
      the Bay of Fundy, would seem to warrant the belief that they may yet be
      found to visit the coast of Maine for this purpose. There seems to be no
      good reason why they should not do so, as the maritime parts of this State
      are apparently as well adapted for nesting as the islands just mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be this as it may, cool northern localities seem to be more advantageous,
      and there, along with the Guillemots as their neighbors, the subject of
      our sketch establishes his home and rears his little family.
    </p>
    <p>
      In boreal regions where the amatory forces are not called into action as
      early as in more southern climes, by reason of the greater degrees of cold
      which prevail, the acquirement of food seems to exercise such a
      controlling influence over bird-nature, that all other duties are held
      under temporary restraint. Consequently, matrimonial relations are not
      entered into as early as in warmer latitudes. This essential business is
      delayed, and is only warmed into activity when the sun has reached the
      northern limits of its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the beginning of June, there occurs a lull in foraging transactions,
      and the sexes become suddenly aware of the object of their creation.
      Mating is at once entered into, but with what appearance of show, we are
      unable to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having attended to this duty, without further ado, they seek themselves
      out a spot in which to lay their egg or eggs. For this purpose a
      horizontal cavern or some exposed locality is generally chosen. But when
      they deposit their eggs along with the Guillemots, which they are
      occasionally disposed to do, they drop them in situations from which the
      water can escape without offering any material injury thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      In deep fissures, many birds lie together, and place their eggs upon small
      beds of pebbles or broken stones, which are raised a couple of inches or
      more, so that the water may readily pass beneath them. Here the eggs are
      scattered at distances of three or four inches from each other, and are
      incubated, as in the case of the Ducks, by the birds sitting flat upon
      them. Whereas, upon an exposed rock, each bird stands almost upright on
      its egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      There yet remains a very strange fact concerning this Auk, which needs to
      be noted. It pertains to the number of eggs which is to constitute a
      nest-full. When nesting occurs in secluded situations, where security
      against tidal currents, and divers accidents, is to be gained, in the
      majority of instances, two eggs are found under a single female. In
      exposed situations, on the other hand, it is a rare occurrence to find
      more than one egg as a complement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above statements, which are substantially those of Audubon, have been
      repeatedly verified by other observers, some of whom are among the
      writer's most reliable correspondents. At first we were disposed to
      question their accuracy. We could not see what advantages a sequestered
      situation had over one that was open and exposed, so as to lead the birds
      to double their number in the former case. Our only way out of the
      difficulty then, was by supposing the two eggs to be laid by different
      birds, in close proximity to each other. For want of the necessary room to
      accommodate the two females, it became the duty of one or the other to
      assume the responsibility of them. Owing to the great difficulty of
      distinguishing the eggs of this species from those of the Murre or Foolish
      Guillemot, which most oologists have experienced, and which Audubon does
      not seem to have encountered, it occurred to us that as the Auks are prone
      to drop their eggs alongside of those of the Guillemots, maybe the two
      eggs were those of distinct species, and not the product of the one under
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further mincing of matters, there does not seem to be any valid
      reason for doubting the authenticity of Audubon's statements. But as a
      true student of Nature, it is our duty to receive the facts, confirmed as
      they have been by subsequent observations, and seek an explanation thereof
      which will be both rational and philosophic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In exposed situations, the eggs are subject to certain perils, such as
      exposures to storms and violent gusts of wind, which more retired places
      would guard against. The Auks have doubtless learned this as a lesson of
      experience. Perhaps, necessity only compels them to occupy such sites,
      when there is a scarcity of deep fissures and horizontal caverns, by
      reason of a superabundance of mated individuals. If one egg could be
      better protected and covered than two, which the nearly erect attitude of
      the bird would seem to warrant us in believing, some females would
      certainly not be slow in perceiving the advantages to be acquired. The
      experiment being tried by birds of unusual sagacity, and with happy
      results, in course of time all the others would be led to the practice of
      depositing a single egg. Furthermore, the laying of one egg, in case of
      breakage, would not be as severely felt as in cases where more than one
      constituted the complement. The habit of laying one egg in exposed
      situations, would doubtless be continued for a while at least, should the
      species so accustomed, ever be called upon to nest in places protected by
      the rocky munitions of Nature. And, on the other hand, birds habituated to
      nesting in sheltered situations, would for a while continue to deposit two
      eggs for a setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs being laid, the female soon commences to incubate. This seems to
      be the exclusive labor of the sex. The fact that she plucks the feathers
      from her abdomen, forming one or two bare spots (according to the number
      which is to compose her complement) with a ridge of feathers between them,
      though circumstantial in character, is the only kind of evidence that we
      have to offer in support of our assertion. Of the precise time required
      for hatching, we have no knowledge. From the size of the egg, and the
      thickness of its shell, we reason from analogy that it cannot be less than
      twenty-four days. The female is not a constant sitter during the daytime,
      the heated pebbles on clear, sunshiny days supplying the necessary warmth
      during her absence. When the weather is cloudy, and even during the cool
      nights, she remains on the nest, the male, as a faithful husband,
      doubtless answering her calls for food, or keeping her company.
    </p>
    <p>
      That these birds manifest true affection for each other cannot be denied.
      They may have a different way of showing it from what we are accustomed to
      see among our small land-birds, but we cannot speak with positiveness. But
      this much is undisputed, when one is killed, its mate does not desert it,
      but paddles around it, as if seeking the cause of its stillness. At such
      times, so absorbed does it become, whether from grief or wonder we cannot
      say, that it can easily be approached and knocked over with an oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The food of the Razor-bills consists of small fishes, roe, shrimps,
      various marine animals, and floating garbage, which they procure by diving
      and swimming, or pick up among the rocks which they frequent. The young
      doubtless subsist upon the same materials, which they receive from their
      parents, in small pieces, during their earliest life. But after they have
      passed the downy stage, and are thrown, in a measure, upon their own
      resources, they imitate the example of their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much like the eggs of the Foolish Guillemot or Murre, already
      mentioned, are those of this species, that it is impossible to discern a
      characteristic so peculiar and persistent as to enable us to distinguish
      them apart. The ground-color is generally a pure-white; but specimens are
      often met with which are cream-colored, and others, again, which are
      tinted with green. The spots and blotches are irregularly distributed, but
      chiefly about the middle and the larger end. Some are small and nearly
      round, others large and irregular. In color they show different shades of
      black and brown. In addition to these markings, there are others scattered
      over the egg, of an obscure-purple hue, which have the appearance of being
      beneath the outside of the shell. The eggs vary in shape; occasionally
      they are pyriform and ovoidal, and, at other times, decidedly ovate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their length is 3.19 inches, and breadth 2.13. In the Plate, the egg is
      figured the natural size, and placed upon the summit of a small pile of
      stones at the entrance to a cavern along a rocky seashore. The birds are
      reduced and put in the background, the idea being to show their form, as
      well as the arrangement of their plumage.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Prairie Warbler
      is nowhere an abundant species. Throughout the eastern parts of the United
      States, from Massachusetts to Georgia, it is pretty generally, though
      somewhat irregularly, diffused. It is also found in Kansas, according to
      Mr. Allen, although unobserved by Dr. Coues in his western explorations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audubon claims to have met it in Louisiana, but his description of its
      nesting is so palpably inaccurate, that we are compelled to accept his
      statement with misgivings. Wilson obtained specimens in Kentucky, and to
      him the species is indebted for the very inappropriate appellation by
      which it is known. Nuttall regarded it a rare visitor in the New England
      States, yet subsequent observations do not confirm his opinion, but show,
      in Massachusetts especially, that it is rather common. In Eastern
      Tennessee and Northern Georgia, in the summer of 1880, Mr. Alexander M.
      Reynolds, of Germantown, Pa., met with numerous individuals, which had
      probably bred in those regions, but no nests were taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the town of Lynn, Mass., in latitude 42° 30', had hitherto been
      accepted as the northern limit of its breeding, yet it was reserved for H.
      D. Minot, Esq., to prove that the species often reached the latitude of
      Mt. Washington, nearly three degrees further north. Future explorations
      will doubtless show that its vernal migration often surpasses this limit,
      and reaches even to the Canadian dominions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Middle Atlantic States the writer has obtained specimens early in
      May, and has observed in Southern New Jersey, and elsewhere, young birds
      just able to fly, but could never discover auy nests. Mr. Jolin Cassin, in
      his day, expressed the opinion that these birds certainly bred in the same
      State, near Philadelphia, as he frequently met with the young under
      similar circumstances. Nests have been taken in Central New York, but we
      have no evidence of its breeding in the adjoining State of Pennsylvania,
      although individuals have been seen <i>in transitu</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though chiefly a migrant in the United States, yet a few winter in
      Florida. But the larger part cross the Channel, after the breeding-season
      is over, and spend their time in the delightful islands which lie to the
      southward. Here, in January, these once beautiful birds may be seen in
      their winter garb sporting amid tropical or sub-tropical foliage, or
      hunting the insects that contribute to their bill of fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the beginning of April, sometimes later, they deck themselves in
      their summer array, and while some sojourn in these Isles of the Blest
      where summer is perennial, and raise their charming little families,
      others pine for the cooler groves and fields of the North. Accordingly,
      about the tenth of April, all things being in readiness, and at a season
      when Nature is weeping herself away in rainy tears, the males apparently
      leading the way, the sexes bid adieu to the sights about them, and take
      their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their arrival in the Middle section of our country varies somewhat, and is
      dependent upon the season. During some years we have noted their
      appearance about the twentieth of April, when the weather was fine, and at
      other times not earlier than the first of May. In the vicinity of
      Washington, Dr. Coues has found them in pine-trees and cedar-patches,
      about the same time. Farther south, in Georgia, for example, the birds
      make their advent as early as the tenth of April, preferring the hillsides
      to open localities, but it is not until the second or the third week of
      May that they reach the New England States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few species of the family to which this Warbler belongs arrive sooner, and
      none are less shy and suspicious. For more than two weeks they are
      denizens of open plains and thinly-wooded regions, where they may be seen
      from sunrise until sunset, save during the sultry noontide hours,
      leisurely moving along the lowermost tree-branches, or among low bushes
      and herbaceous weeds by the roadside, in search of insects, all the while
      uttering, at brief intervals, their characteristic <i>chirr</i>. Near
      Boston they frequent "almost exclusively rocky pasture grounds and the
      'scrub,'" and instances are recorded by Mr. Minot where shrubbery in
      cultivated grounds has been visited. According to Mr. Gosse, individuals
      have been seen to fly from wayside-bushes into the middle of the road,
      where, hovering in the air, at slight elevations above the ground, they
      were apparently engaged in the capture of dipterous insects.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the mating season approaches, the males become quite restless. They
      manifest less concern about food, and from some low eminence may be seen
      pouring forth their slender, filing notes, which, as Nuttall has
      represented, may be very aptly expressed by the suppressed syllables '<i>tsh-tsh-tsh-tshea</i>.
      These notes cannot fail to attract attention, and, when once heard, are
      sure to leave a lasting impress on the mind. They are uttered in a
      peculiar tone, each being given in a louder key than the preceding, and
      frequently with a strange depression of the tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little musicians, however, have not long to wait. For hours we have
      known some love-lorn minstrel of another species to sing his very soul
      away, without an answering note to repay him for all his trouble. The one
      for which he tuned his vocal pipe was too much occupied by other cares to
      be mindful of the delicious strains which were being wasted 011 the desert
      air. But not so in the present instance. The dear ones for whom they
      watch, and for whom they chant their sweetest, purest music, are not so
      far removed by hill and dale, by grove and plain, are not so absorbed in
      food-concerns, as not to hear the sounds which are being uttered for their
      sole pleasure. But obedient to the call, they cease their feeding, turn
      listening ears in the directions whence the sounds issue, and hearing once
      again, with pleasure-beaming eyes and swelling bosoms, seek the lonely
      haunts of their would-be-suitors. The joy of the males is now unbounded.
      They strike their harps afresh, and music, it seems, ten-fold more
      ravishing, is discoursed. The effect is charming. The gentle beings feel
      the notes pulsing through their rapt frames, and, all-unconscious, yield
      themselves willing subjects to their proud conquerors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it is that mating is accomplished. A few days spent in aimless
      wanderings and pleasure-seeking, and the happy pair are prepared to build
      themselves a home. For this purpose they visit in company some wild
      pasture-land or thinly-wooded tract, where, after a day or two occupied in
      prospecting, they decide upon some kind of bush or low tree in which to
      place it. The birds do not seem to be very particular as to the kind. In
      some localities, a wild rose-bush is preferred. In others, low barberry
      bushes, or the lower limbs of post-oaks, are rendered subservient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site, and the kind of bush or tree being chosen, the birds commence to
      build. The nest is non-pensile, and is fixed either in a forked branch, or
      is supported, as is the case when placed in a wild rose, by two or more
      branches. The elevation above the ground is usually from four to seven
      feet. No case has come to our knowledge where the latter height has been
      exceeded. The period of nesting varies according to locality. In Georgia
      nests have been found with eggs as early as the second of May, which would
      make it appear that they were constructed towards the close of the
      preceding month. In one instance, eggs were found as late as the tenth of
      June. It is probable that the birds commence labor about the first of May,
      in this section of the country, and sitting, a fortnight later. In New
      Jersey this essential business is delayed until the middle of this month,
      while in Massachusetts, it is not undertaken before the first week of
      June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having built their domicile, which is usually the work of a week, both
      birds laboring with praiseworthy diligence, and only intermitting
      operations when pressed by bad weather and the approach of night, the
      female commences to deposit her eggs. These are laid on consecutive days,
      at the rate of one a day. The time devoted to oviposition lasts from three
      to six days, and is dependent, upon the number which is to constitute a
      complement. As soon as the last deposit is made, the female takes the
      nest, and continues thereon, save when the male relieves her, for a period
      of eleven days, when she is rewarded for her patience and assiduity, by
      seeing and hearing a nest-full of callow fledglings. While the female is
      thus engaged, the male is busy among the branches of low bushes and
      saplings in search of small caterpillars and insects. Occasionally, he may
      be seen upon the shrub which supports the nest, apparently on the alert
      for intruders, which he signals by a low chirp. Should the nest be
      examined, he and his partner exhibit no outward signs of indignation or
      lamentation, but remain quietly in the neighborhood until the danger is
      past, when they return to their home. If the nest is ravaged, they set to
      work to replenish it, wasting little, if any, time over the contingencies
      of fate. In case of a second desecration, they quietly forsake the place,
      and if the season is not too far advanced, seek quarters elsewhere, where
      they endeavor to build a home and rear their offspring. On approaching the
      nest the female is very confiding, and exercises no precautions to guard
      against exposure, as is the case with many of our small birds. Nuttall
      gives a striking proof of this fact. On one occasion he removed two eggs
      from the nest, which he subsequently replaced. Each time, on withdrawal,
      she returned thither, but practised no stratagems to lure him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their descriptions of the nests and eggs of this species both Wilson
      and Audubon are certainly at fault. They differ from more recent and
      reliable observations. The nest, as described by them, is never pensile,
      but is scarcely distinguishable from that of the Yellow Warbler. Xuttall,
      on the other hand, is not open to the same criticism. The nest which he
      describes, was placed in a forked branch, and formed of caterpillars'
      silk, strips of the inner bark of the red cedar, and fibres of asclepias.
      The inside was lined with the down of a species of everlasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nest found by Mr. Welch, in Lynn, and described by Dr. Brewer, was built
      upon a wild rose, only a few feet above the ground. It was a compact and
      elaborately woven fabric, and was composed chiefly of soft inner bark of
      small shrubs, bits of dry rose leaves, wood, strips of vegetables, woody
      fibres, spiders' webs, decayed stems of plants, etc., on the outside, and
      was lined with fine vegetable fibres and a few horse-hairs. The outside
      diameter was two and a half inches, and the height, the same. The inside
      diameter was two inches; depth, one and a half. The above nest, in its
      general mode of construction, resembled all he had seen. In other nests he
      found only variations in composing materials. While some had dead and
      decayed leaves instead of fine strips of bark, others contained the
      remains of old cocoons, or the pappus of composite plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the structure from which the drawing was made, was found June 4th,
      1875, in the vicinity of Newton, Mass., by J. Warren, Esq. It was placed
      in a rose-bush, about three feet from the ground. Outside it is composed
      of bark of deciduous trees, vegetable fibres, spiders' webs, old cocoons,
      dry leaves, pappus of composite plants, and cotton ravellings. The inside
      is lined with the white silken fibres of the wild flax, constituting a
      rather dense layer, over which is placed a small stratum of black and
      white horse-hairs intermingled with vegetable fibres and the inner bark of
      woody plants. The external diameter is two and a half inches, and the
      height two. The cavity is one and three-fourths inches, and one and a half
      deep. In shape, the nest is nearly hemispherical, compactly and
      elaborately made, and, above all, constitutes a very snug and cosy
      structure. In these particulars it bears a very close resemblance to the
      nest of the Summer Yellow-bird, but differs in the character of the
      composing materials, there being less of the satiny fibres of the flax
      used in its workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are of an oval shape, pointed at one extremity, and measure .09
      of an inch in length, and .49 in width. The ground-color is white, and
      over it are scattered spots of lilac and purple, as well as others of two
      shades of umber-brown. In all the specimens which we have examined from
      New England and Northern Georgia the spots are mostly accumulated about
      the larger half of the egg, those upon the smaller portion being finer and
      less numerous.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Mourning Dove,
      one of the best known of our American species, is quite generally diffused
      throughout the United States. It is found from the Gulf of Mexico to
      Colorado, and from the Atlantic westward to the Pacific Ocean. In the
      Northern States it is chiefly migratory; in the Middle Atlantic but
      partially so; while in the country south of Pennsylvania it is a winter
      resident, and manifests a tendency to gregariousness, flocks of hundreds,
      and even more, being seen during the winter in the woods of South Carolina
      and Georgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      East of the Rocky Mountains, as well as in the vast region stretching
      westward, they occur in greater or less abundance. To be sure there are
      localities where they are notably scarce, but only in regions unblessed by
      Nature with suitable accommodations for nesting purposes, and with the
      essential means of subsistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the South, breeding occasionally takes place early in March, but
      ordinarily not before the beginning of April. Not so in more northern
      sections. The eighth of March, which is also the time of their appearance
      in the Middle States, marks the period of their arrival in New England,
      although in Eastern Pennsylvania, during very backward seasons, their
      visit is often delayed until the fifteenth of April. But, in the extreme
      northern parts of our country, various circumstances combine to render
      their coming an event of later occurrence, for we find that they do not
      reach the States of Michigan and Wisconsin much before the twentieth of
      the month. The vicissitudes incident to change of climate and new
      environments all operate to prevent the assumption of matrimonial
      relations as early as in semi-tropical climes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon arrival, they seem to abandon their gregarious habits, and appear
      only in pairs, seldom more than a half-dozen paired individuals being
      found in any square mile of territory. During the short period which
      elapses before building operations are begun, which lasts from three to
      four weeks, they occupy the time in feeding, in dusting themselves by the
      roadside, or in the enjoyment of each other's society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few species display, where undisturbed, greater confidence in man. It
      visits the farm-yard and consorts with the poultry, partaking of their
      food, and even repairs to the drinking-places of the cattle for water. In
      many localities it courts rather than shuns human society, and exists in a
      semi-domesticated state. While some of these birds thus deport themselves,
      others manifest much shyness, and keep away from the habitations of man.
      But these will mostly be found to be young birds, which have not been able
      to fling off the timidity which they have probably inherited.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years ago, in Eastern Pennsylvania, it was a rare occurrence to find
      a nest of this species in close proximity to houses. Nowadays it is seldom
      that one can be found remote therefrom. The kindly spirit which the humane
      farmer has been wont to show towards the species has doubtless been
      productive of these happy results. It is an astonishing fact, and one that
      is worthy of being recorded, that mischievous boys who have a penchant for
      disturbing the homes of other birds, for some unaccountable reason, permit
      these gentle creatures to pursue their household duties without fear or
      trouble. Perhaps their unassuming, trustful disposition, placid demeanor,
      and winning ways, have the effect of softening-rugged human natures, and
      thus securing them deserved respect. When the subject of our sketch is
      better known, it is gratifying to think, that much of the same spirit of
      kindness and mercy will be evinced elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having spent a few weeks in luxurious living and pleasure, and the season
      of house-keeping being nigh at hand, these birds forsake their accustomed
      haunts, abandon the epicurean lives which they have been leading, come,
      more and more into each other's society, and, at last, are brought to
      confer together on the important business which has called them away from
      their genial Southern homes. Though carried on in a tongue which is a
      stranger to our own, the object and meaning of the conference are not
      entirely enigmatical to us. The language of gestures which accompanies
      their dark sayings, supplies in a measure the key to the mystery, and
      enables us to judge thereof with tolerable accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference being over, there is no longer any doubt of the motives
      which inspired it. But before starting on this important mission of
      selecting a home-spot, the male must needs congratulate his loving mate on
      the success of the interview, and renew his pledges of love and fidelity.
      With dignified carriage and stately tread he parades himself before her,
      uttering all the while, in sad and plaintive tones, which poorly comport
      with his happy, sportive demeanor, his peculiar but unmistakable <i>ah-côô-rôô-côô-rôô</i>.
      These syllables are repeated in rapid succession, and often for three or
      four minutes at a time. During the intervals of nesting, and not
      unfrequently while oviposition and incubation are going on, the male is
      known to utter the same sounds; but when the trying duties of parentage
      demand his attention, he has neither the time nor the inclination to
      indulge in such pastime.

      In the selection of a building-spot, but little discrimination is
      exercised. Almost any locality will answer the purpose. Generally an
      orchard, a pine-grove, a grain-field, or a swamp is chosen. With some the
      position seems to be of little moment, as nests are often found upon the
      tops of rail-fences, on stumps, in bushes, in depressions of the ground,
      as well as on trees. When an orchard is selected, the apple is preferred
      to any other fruit-tree. But in the East, the various species of pines
      outside of orchards are in supreme demand. In Texas, the mesquite tree is
      made to do service; while in California, according to Dr. J. G. Cooper,
      the willow and live oak. On the Plains, however, where there is a scarcity
      of trees, we are told that the nests are placed on the ground, and even,
      in some instances, in hollows in the sand, with the merest apology of a
      nest visible. Occasionally, in Eastern Pennsylvania, the structure is
      placed in a shallow depression, alongside of an unfrequented path, or in
      the centre thereof. Experience teaches that such situations are mostly the
      choice of young birds, or more properly speaking, of birds of the past
      season. Such sites have certainly some advantage over arboreal ones, for
      the obvious reason that much valuable time and labor are thus saved in the
      construction of nests. On the other hand, there is this disadvantage&mdash;namely,
      that they expose the inmates to the attacks of snakes and nocturnal
      animals of a predatory character, more so than those built upon bushes and
      trees.

      In the building of a home both birds labor jointly. The male, for the sake
      of variety, often fetches the materials to his partner, which she adjusts.
      But generally each bird gathers the pieces for itself, and arranges them
      according to its own notions of beauty and symmetry. The time spent in the
      work seldom exceeds two days. Under favorable circumstances, and with
      praiseworthy diligence upon the part of the architects, the work could be
      done inside of a day. Many of the ground-structures, which, at the best,
      are but a few dry grasses loosely piled together, are only the labor of a
      few hours. Judging from the simplicity of the fabric, and the lack of
      design manifested, it ought not to require much time; but we must
      recollect that the birds are not continually occupied with the task during
      the day, and also that they are comparatively slow mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest is usually placed upon a wide, horizontal limb, with partially
      vertical branches on all sides, or between a crotch formed by a smaller
      twig meeting a larger one. The height above the ground varies from five to
      thirty feet, but most nests are placed at elevations ranging from eight to
      fifteen feet. Ordinarily these structures are composed of small twigs,
      chiefly pine, gathered from the ground. The pieces are scarcely more than
      one-fourth of an inch in thickness, and about four inches in length. In
      position they repose in layers arranged crosswise, and with a small
      downward tendency, so as to cause a central depression. Sometimes the
      first pieces are perfectly level for the space of an inch or more, and the
      necessary inclination is given to the topmost layers, which are made to
      dip towards the centre of the nest. Basally, the structure is four inches
      wide, but gradually increases to four and a half at the top. The height is
      two and a half inches, and the depth of the cavity often less than a half
      inch, and so shallow that the superior surfaces of the eggs actually
      extended above the level of the outside margin. So superficial is the
      cavity, in some cases, that the eggs and young are often jostled upon the
      ground when the wind blows with more than ordinary velocity. To obviate
      this difficulty, as much as possible, a tree is often chosen on the
      southern aspect of a hill, or in a place carefully protected by natural or
      artificial defences. From the elevated nest the ground-structure differs
      immaterially. This difference is to be observed not in size, nor in the
      manner of construction, but in composition. All nests which we have seen
      from places both east and west of our great central mountain system, have
      the ground-work of grass-stems, stubble, etc., loosely arranged, and are
      lined with fine culms and leaves of soft grasses. In the Plate the nest is
      considerably reduced, placed in the background, and on a branch of a
      species of pine. The female is also diminished, and represented as engaged
      in the duties of incubation; whereas the male, owing to his beauty of form
      and plumage, is given special prominence, and appears three-fourths of his
      natural dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Gulf States, Louisiana especially, according to Mr. Audubon,
      nesting generally begins in April, and sometimes as early as March. In
      Pennsylvania, frequently as early as the fifteenth of the former month,
      except in seasons which are unusually backward, when this important
      business is delayed until May. The fifteenth of this month marks the time
      in New England. In Illinois, and other Western States, it begins in early
      April, while along the Pacific coast, the period ranges from the first to
      the twentieth of May. Two broods are annually raised in most localities.
      The second does not, it seems, appear at any regular time, but may no show
      itself as early as the fifteenth of June, or as late as the middle of
      September, or during any intermediate period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest being prepared for occupancy, on the ensuing day the female
      commences to deposit her first egg. This is followed by a second on the
      next day, when further efforts in this direction cease, and incubation at
      once proceeds. This lasts for fourteen days, and is chiefly the task of
      the female. Although the male occasionally takes the nest, yet his
      principal duty is to supply his mistress with food. When not thus
      occupied, he is seldom observed on the same tree, but stations himself
      close-by, where he is ready at all times to answer to her summons. Should
      the nest be approached by human enemies, the female makes no effort to
      protect it, but vacates in a. hurry, and silently contemplates, from a
      stump, or fence-rail, in the immediate vicinity, the intended desecration.
      The male, however, is more timid, and surveys the scene with the same
      quiet, sorrow-stricken expression, but from a safe distance. A few days of
      lamentation, and their troubles are in a measure forgotten. The
      disappointed couple, if the season be not too far advanced, not to be
      frustrated in their plans, now seek other quarters, where they hope to
      achieve the object of their mission in peace and prosperity. In places
      where the nest is not interfered with, the same spot is chosen on each
      return of the breeding-season.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one feature about these birds that should not be passed over. We
      refer to their fidelity. Unlike many females, our lady-bird disdains the
      meaningless flirtations which characterize the actions of so many of our
      smaller insessorial birds about the mating-time. In no way does she
      encourage the attentions of other birds, nor will she even tolerate them.
      The male is not behind his partner in this particular. To show his
      appreciation of her, a dozen times a day he comes before her presence,
      parades himself backward and forward in front of her admiring gaze, trails
      his wings, and, ever and anon, puffs himself up to more than his ordinary
      capacity. Assured of her pleasure, he temporarily abandons these pompous
      manouvres, and manifests his regard for her by thrusting his bill into her
      mouth and discharging therein the contents of his crop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The love which the male lavishes upon his mate, is none the deeper and
      intenser than that which the sexes bestow upon their offspring. Few
      birdies are objects of more special regard upon the parental part. From
      morning until night the parents are constantly on the search for some racy
      <i>tidbit</i> to gratify their fastidious appetites. Beetles, spiders, and
      such like, which are savory articles of meat to a Robin and Bluebird, are
      not considered fit for these dainty creatures, who must needs be nurtured
      with food of a more kingly nature. Prepared food, as rich, as nutritious,
      doubtless, as the honey which the Brazilian Fairy imbibes from painted
      tulip and chaliced lily, are their portion. Nature does not prepare it as
      she does the nectar of flowers, and offer it up to their toothsome
      appetites, but she has endowed the authors of their being with the power
      so to do. Deep down in the innermost recesses of their bosom exists a
      churn, which learned men call the <i>crop</i>, and here it is prepared.
      This tempting food consists of a lacteous secretion and the macerated
      materials of the crop. Its preparation is the work not of the female
      exclusively, but of both parents. The method of feeding is quite
      interesting, and after the fashion of the common domestic pigeon. As in
      this case, either parent thrusts its bill into the mouth of the young, and
      by a process of regurgitation, forces the contents of its crop into the
      stomach of the latter. Nor does their food consist always of such a
      substance, but only during the first five or six days of their existence,
      for at the expiration of this time, various caterpillars of the
      measuring-worm family, and other smooth-skinned larvæ, are gathered, and
      after being completely killed and mashed, are fed to their rapacious
      appetites. When seventeen days old, the young are able to leave the nest.
      They are not, however, ready to seek their own fortunes until a fortnight
      later. Strange to say, the nest-full usually contains a bird of each sex&mdash;a
      beautiful and wise provision of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having attained to maturity, the young still linger with the parents in
      the old, familiar haunts, until the season for departure arrives&mdash;about
      the middle of September&mdash;when they leave together. It is nothing
      uncommon to find several families associating with each other, forming
      some sort of society, in which the most perfect harmony and good-will
      prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      When captured, either in the young or adult stages, and confined within
      cages, these birds soon become reconciled to their lot, and make quite
      agreeable pets. They quickly recognize their keepers, and learn to come at
      their call. As to the matter of raising them, there does not seem to be
      any great difficulty. The different kinds of bird-seeds, rape and canary
      especially, being very nutritious, can be fed to them with splendid
      results. When vegetation is in season, chick-weed, grasses, and the tender
      leaves of the common cultivated salad, will be found equally successful.
      Care must be taken to see that they are also provided with plenty of
      gravel and fresh water. In confinement as many as four broods have been
      known to be raised. In his interesting volume on the "Birds and Seasons of
      New England," Mr. Flagg gives his experience. When a boy he came into
      possession of one of these birds. At the time of its capture, it was
      nearly ready to fly. A strictly farinaceous diet enabled him to bring it
      to maturity. As it grew, it became very tame, and resembled in its actions
      the young of a domesticated Dove. This bird was always allowed to wander
      at will. When hungry, it would fly off to a distance, and having satisfied
      the demands of its being, would regularly return to its accustomed
      quarters. At length it grew so docile, that it would often fly to its
      master and sit upon his hand. Other instances of a similar character might
      be mentioned, many of which have come under our own immediate observation,
      but we forbear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this Dove are of an elongated oval form, nearly symmetrical at
      each end, and of a pure-white color. A clutch from Pennsylvania measures
      respectively 1.18 by .87 and 1.20 by .88 of an inch. Specimens from Texas,
      California and Maine manifest not more than ordinary variations of size.
      The largest egg, out of four sets which were sent to us from the Pacific
      coast, has a length of 1.21 of an inch, and a width of .86; the smallest,
      .97 by .84 inches. The same difference holds reasonably true with respect
      to samples from other localities.

      Plate XX.&mdash;TINNUNCULUS SPARVERIUS, (Lnn.) Vieillot.&mdash;Sparrow
      Hawk.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Sparrow Hawk is
      the handsomest of American birds of prey. Few small species are more
      active in the pursuit of quarry, and none more friendly and sociable in
      their intercourse with man. It receives its common name from the
      fringilline character of its fare, our various Sparrows forming a no
      inconsiderable portion thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Maine to California, and from Hudson's Bay to the Mexican
      possessions, these birds abound in greater or less abundance, but are
      notably scarce, or entirely wanting, in the Arctic regions of British
      America, and in our newly acquired territory of Alaska. The highest points
      which they have been supposed to reach are Fort Resolution, on Great Slave
      Lake, and Fort Rae. Throughout nearly the whole of this vast region they
      undoubtedly summer, and spend the time in the rearing of families.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the United States the species is a <i>rara avis</i> in some places,
      and a very abundant one in others. In the vicinity of Calais, Maine, it is
      quite common, which is otherwise the case in Eastern Massachusetts,
      although in the western parts of the latter State, birds have been known
      to breed. In the Middle Atlantic States, New York and Pennsylvania
      especially, it is a not uncommon occurrence to find it in great plenty,
      often as many as a dozen paired individuals being seen within a single
      square mile of territory. Throughout the West, but more particularly in
      the canyons of the eastern range of the Humboldt Mountains, Ridgway
      attests to its abundance, and also to its disposition to nest in hollows
      of limestone cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the approach of winter these birds desert the northern and middle
      sections of our country, and mostly retire to warm southern latitudes
      beyond Virginia. According to Mr. Samuels, they are permanent residents of
      the lower districts of New England, although but slightly so in cold
      weather, if the observations of other writers of equal prominence are to
      be relied upon. In Florida they are found at all seasons, but mostly in
      the higher latitudes of the State during the breeding-season. West of the
      Rockies, and in the region watered by the "Father of Waters" and its
      numerous tributaries, they are probably but transient occupants; yet there
      seems to be no strong reason why they should not find comfortable
      winter-quarters in Southern California and in the regions situated between
      the same isothermal lines. When the Western history of this species has
      been more closely studied, this will doubtless prove the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The period of migration in the Middle Atlantic States seems dependent upon
      climatic influences. When the season is tardy by reason of long, cold
      winters, the birds do not arrive until after the middle of April; but when
      the weather is fine, and the prospect favors a continuance thereof, they
      ordinarily make their appearance early in the month. In New England,
      doubtless somewhat later, if the time of laying forms any argument upon
      which to base a conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon its arrival in the vicinity of Philadelphia, the species takes up its
      abode in old orchards chiefly, where it can be convenient to the homes of
      man. While here it destroys immense numbers of field-mice and noxious
      insects, and is certainly one of our foremost feathered benefactors. To be
      sure it will destroy a few young chickens occasionally, by way of changing
      the monotony of its life, but the immense good which it otherwise
      accomplishes, should induce humanity to throw a veil over its
      thoughtlessness and imprudence, and extend to it a cordial welcome. So
      small a bird could hardly perpetrate much mischief, and therefore should
      not be dreaded. Its many visits to the farm-yard are not made solely with
      the view of depredating upon the poultry, but for the purpose of feeding
      upon the vermin which infest the out-buildings, and which are so
      destructive to the garnered grain. These visits should be encouraged by
      all means. The adult chicken is too heavy a burden for such apparently
      frail creatures to bear away, and as for the young, they are generally too
      well guarded by the parent, to become very easy victims. It is only when
      the chicks have been scattered, that this Hawk has the audacity and
      hardihood to venture an assault upon the brood. Unlike many species, our
      little friend does not pursue its prey, but prefers to watch for it while
      perched upon a dead tree, or on a projecting twig. Here, solitary and
      alone, it will remain for hours, without perceptibly changing its
      position. The only motion visible at the time, is a peculiar jerking of
      the tail, which seems to betray an over-anxiety for something to turn up.
      A very common place of resort is a clump of bushes, or a hedge-row. The
      abundance of small birds which seek such situations being the cause of the
      attraction thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the sexes keep apart from each other, and feast on the fat of the
      land, until the latter part of April, or the beginning of May, when the
      male, who is the first to abandon this selfish mode of life, desists
      therefrom, though hardly without a great effort, and prepares to lead the
      way by calling his partner from her near or far-off feeding-grounds.
      Standing upon a dead branch in an open situation, he sounds his peculiar
      call-note, at somewhat irregular intervals, and, anon, turns himself round
      as though to catch the well-known response, or to see the agreeable
      presence. For hours at a time he may be thus seen where undisturbed by
      bird or man. If no reply is elicited, he darts away in great hurry, and
      tries his fortunes elsewhere. This is usually the case with young males.
      But with old birds the rule is different. They mostly select the partners
      of past years, and there is always less formality in renewals of plighted
      vows. The suits of the younger and more spirited males are often attended
      with considerable difficulty. This arises chiefly from the fickleness and
      waywardness of the young females, who seem hard to woo, and who often
      indulge in cruel flirtations, much to the annoyance of their respective
      suitors. These little pranks upon their part are generally of short
      continuance, and soon decided one way or the other. If settled in favor of
      the several actors, the latter become highly elated, and give expression
      to their feelings in the most ridiculous manner. The females now become as
      unwavering and devoted in their fidelity and affection as they were before
      changeable and whimsical. The period of courtship seldom exceeds two days
      at the utmost. While it lasts, the birds make short tours around the
      country, and on their return settle down to the prosy realities of wedded
      life. A suitable spot must be selected for a home. Although both birds
      spend no little time in searching for one, yet the matter is generally and
      wisely left to the judgment of the female.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are never known to construct homes for themselves, but make use of
      hollow trees, Wookpeckers' holes, and often the old and forsaken nests of
      the common Crow and the Gray Squirrel. A low, flat shelving of rock
      beneath an overhanging bluff, in situations remote from the dwellings of
      man, is not unfrequently chosen. But in' places immediately surrounding
      him, and even within his precincts, unfinished stone-buildings and
      pigeon-cotes are occupied, the latter much to the dread of their rightful
      owners, who soon become reconciled to the glaring insult, and live on
      friendly terms with their courageous neighbors. In Germantown, Pa., many
      of these birds are accustomed to deposit their eggs in the holes left by
      the removal of scaffolding from the walls of unfinished buildings. In some
      instances, they are placed within a slight depression produced by the
      removal of the mortar; but, generally, a thin covering of leaves and
      grasses serves to relieve the roughness of the cavity. In one case a
      rather dense bedding of moss made a soft and cozy lining. Almost any tree
      that has been pressed into service by the Golden-shafted Woodpecker, and
      made to answer as a receptacle for its eggs, is utilized by the species
      under consideration. In an orchard, the apple is mostly a favorite; while
      in other situations, the swamp maple and common chestnut are as frequently
      occupied. Their height above the ground varies from ten to fifty feet. In
      no cases have we discovered it below this figure, and never above it. A
      nest found April 20th, 1881, near Rowlandville, by William Wentz, in a
      decayed chestnut branch, was fifty feet from the ground, and consisted
      entirely of dry grasses in quite limited quantity. This is the earliest
      one ever found in this locality. Generally, the nest is completed for
      oviposition during the last of this month, or the beginning of the
      succeeding. My son, Alan F. Gentry, on the fourth of May of the same year,
      met with one in a hollow branch of the chestnut, in Germantown. This was
      placed about twenty feet up, in a cavity whose width at the mouth was four
      and a half inches, and whose depth was nine inches. It was lined with a
      few leaves and fragments of decayed wood, and contained four eggs, which
      were partially incubated. Another complement of eggs, five in number,
      before us, was found May 17th, 1880, near Granville, N. Y., by F. T.
      Pember, Esq. It was placed in an isolated maple, about twenty feet from
      the ground, in what was once the home of a pair of Flickers. The bottom of
      the cavity was lined with straw and grass of last year's deposit, little,
      if any, fresh materials being noticeable. The diameter of the base was
      seven inches, and depth, twenty inches. The drawing represents a nest in a
      decayed branch of the red maple. The female bird is considerably reduced,
      and placed on the edge of the cavity, looking outwardly; whereas the male,
      in perfectly erect attitude, and with dignified demeanor, stands on a bent
      branch, at some distance from his home, engaged, as it were, in surveying
      the surrounding scenery. He is shown in his jauntiest feathers, and with
      his fair proportions diminished but one-fourth. Owing to the difficulty
      encountered in figuring the eggs <i>in situ</i>, we have been compelled to
      show a single specimen, the natural size, and on a tinted background below
      and to the left of the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest being ready, the female is not dilatory about laying. Unlike most
      of the birds which we have previously described, she does not deposit with
      much regularity. Sometimes the eggs are laid on consecutive days, and, at
      other times, on each alternate day; never more than one being deposited
      daily. This business being accomplished, the female proceeds at once to
      incubate. After she has been thus occupied for a varying period of time,
      seldom less than two hours at a sitting, she summons her mate to her side,
      and resigns to him the laborious task for a season. While one is on the
      nest, the other, when not in quest of food, is on a tree in the immediate
      neighborhood, quietly on the alert. If danger is imminent, the
      sitting-bird is apprised of the fact in time to make its escape. This
      done, the two endeavor to protect their home from pillage. As long as
      there is some prospect of frightening away the depredators, they keep up
      the warfare with a good show of courage. But when constrained to desist
      from the attack by the too near approach of enemies, they do not forsake
      their home entirely, but choose a point out of reach of harm, where they
      station themselves, and behold with profound distress its demolition. In
      these attacks the female is the superior of her masculine companion, and
      exhibits the most reckless bravery. The latter is, however, more
      circumspect and cautious. But should the enemy be a feathered species, and
      of superior physique, the unequal warfare is waged with terrible fury, and
      often results in favor of the defendants. Where not interfered with by
      man, these birds have been known to visit the same locality year after
      year; but when meddled with, they abandon the site for another of greater
      security. The period of incubation ranges from fifteen to sixteen days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are very helpless creatures when first hatched, and often tax
      the patience and vigilance of the parents to the utmost in their efforts
      to obtain for them a <i>quantum sufficit</i> of nourishing food. Both
      birds are seldom absent together on this important mission. While one is
      abroad, the other remains at home, and exercises the strictest
      surveillance. The food of the young at first consists of grasshoppers,
      crickets, and caterpillars of the family of measuring-worms. Being rapid
      growers, they are soon able to digest bits of small rodents and birds,
      which the parents tear from the warm flesh of the quivering victims which
      they hold in their talons. When four weeks old, parental assistance is in
      a measure withdrawn, and they are forced to feed themselves. A fortnight
      longer, they quit the nest, and receive their meals while perched on the
      tree-branches. But it is not until they attain an age of two months that
      they are entirely thrown upon their own resources. They, however, continue
      to reside with their parents, but for what length of time, we are unable
      to say. Like the latter, their appetites are very fastidious, tainted and
      unsavory food being rejected with disgust. When the young have vacated the
      nest, Audubon asserts that the parents are known to imitate their feeble
      cries, as they travel together in pursuit of game. Ordinarily, the cry of
      the adult birds is a peculiar series of notes, which are pronounced in a
      very shrill manner, and most difficult of imitation. It is said to
      resemble the call of the European Kestrel, and would doubtless be mistaken
      for it, were it not for its more powerful intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When taken from the nest, these Hawks are readily domesticated, and make
      very interesting pets. Audubon once reared a young bird, which he kept
      about the house. At nights it would roost upon a favorite window-shutter.
      In the daytime it would wander about the fields, where it was often
      assailed by its wilder kindred. On these occasions, instead of making a
      stand and resenting such uncivilized conduct, it would invariably beat a
      precipitate flight to the house where it was sure of finding protection.
      At length this poor bird was killed by an enraged hen, one of whose chicks
      it was essaying to capture. While in Columbia, South Carolina, Dr. Coues
      saw three of these birds in the possession of a neighbor. They had been
      taken while quite young, and were perfectly reconciled to their
      imprisonment. During early life they ate all kinds of meat, but as they
      approached the age of maturity, they began to display much of their
      natural disposition. When disturbed they would show their displeasure by
      snapping the bill, and clutching at the offending cane with their talons.
      Among the number there was a cripple who was most dreadfully misused and
      bullied by his companions. One night, being insufficiently fed or
      unusually irritable, they set upon the poor fellow, killed him, and had
      nearly made way with him by the returning morn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species vary in number from four to seven, complements of
      fives and sixes being oftener found than any other. In one case a set of
      three was found by a friend of the writer's, but this was probably
      exceptional in its character. The ground-color is never fixed, but passes
      from a beautiful white, through a dark cream, into one that is decidedly
      buff. In some specimens, under a glass of moderate power, the ground is a
      perfectly uniform buff, but in others which appear to the unaided vision
      of the same color, the lens reveals a whitish background very densely
      covered with minute dottings. There is also noticeable considerable
      variation in the markings. Three from a nest in Philadelphia, with a
      pure-white ground-color, are marked with dottings and blotches of
      light-brown, sparsely scattered over the greater portion of their
      surfaces, excepting a space of the size of a dime about either extremity,
      where a dark and almost continuous patch of reddish-brown occurs, relieved
      by a few small spots of blackish-brown. These eggs are nearly spherical,
      of the ordinary shape, and have an average measurement of 1.38 by 1.14
      inches. Another set, four in number, from near Germantown, Pa., have a
      light-buff ground, and are completely covered with fine markings of brown,
      and others of bolder spots of the same, so as almost to conceal the color
      below. They average the same in dimensions as the preceding, and are
      similarly shaped. A clutch of five from Granville, N. Y., is the exact
      counterpart of the Germantown specimens in every particular. All eggs
      which we have seen from New England, the South, and the West, California
      in particular, though subject to variations in size and ornamentation, are
      uniform as to shape. The length usually varies from 1.32 to 1.49, and the
      width from 1.07 to 1.20 inches.

      Plate XXI.&mdash;AIX SPONSA, (Linn.) Boie.&mdash;Wood Duck; Summer Duck.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Wood Duck,
      appropriately so named because it breeds in trees, surpasses in elegance
      of plumage and gracefulness of action all North American birds of its
      family. Although known by the name of Summer Duck, from the fact of its
      remaining with us during the entire hot season, and not journeying to the
      cold regions of the North as many of its brethren are wont to do, it is
      however more commonly designated by the former appellation. Few species
      are more highly esteemed by lovers of the beautiful in Nature than this,
      and, where obtainable, it is one of the first that finds its way into the
      private collection of the amateur naturalist. But by epicures, it is
      considered as of rather inferior standing, lacking the delicacy of flesh
      which makes the Green-winged Teal and others of such immense gastronomic
      value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although truly an American species, it is more generally found throughout
      the United States than any other, nesting wherever suitable localities
      present themselves. North of the Potomac, and in the various States
      situated above the parallel which cuts its head-waters, at least so far as
      the country east of the Rocky Mountains is concerned, it is chiefly a
      migrant, arriving towards the latter part of March, or the beginning of
      April. South of this line, from Maryland to Florida, and in a
      southwesterly direction through the Gulf States into Mexico, the birds are
      found in more or less abundance during the entire year.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the South Atlantic and Gulf States, they generally pair, we are told,
      about the first of March, but in New England and the Middle States, in
      favorable seasons, from the first to the fifteenth of April, perhaps
      later; and in the country bordering on the Great Lakes, about the last of
      May or the beginning of June. In Iowa, and other Western States of the
      same latitude, from the fifteenth to the last of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon its arrival in our Northern States, remarkable to say, unlike many of
      its numerous family connections, it seldom frequents the seashore, or the
      adjoining salt marshes, but manifests a predilection for the ponds,
      mill-dams, and deep muddy streams of the interior. The same is true of its
      more southern breeding-grounds along creeks and bayous of the land where
      the orange and palmetto charm the eye with perennial verdure.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the interval of time between the appearance of these birds and the
      renewal of their ancient vows at the accustomed trysting-place, the sexes
      consort together in ever-varying flocks of fours or more, but never in
      very large numbers, and fatten on acorns, the seeds of the wild oats, and
      such insects as they can procure from the tree-branches, or the muddy
      margins of the streams and ponds which they frequent.
    </p>
    <p>
      On each recurrence of the mating season, there is reason for believing
      that the same couple come together, and pledge anew the sincerity of their
      fidelity, and the constancy of their affection, unless debarred from so
      doing by death, or some other of the numerous vicissitudes to which life
      is prone. The troth-plight being sealed, the happy lovers are not slow in
      effecting a union. A few reciprocations of love, mutual and sympathetic,
      and the <i>role</i> is ended. But in cases where the male has lost his
      partner, doubtless more time is devoted to this important business. Much
      time is spent in seeking a suitable companion, and even when the seeker is
      successful in finding one which combines the necessary qualities, no
      little time is frittered away in rendering himself agreeable to her lady's
      notions of what a husband should be, for she not unfrequently acts as if
      she were possessed of some taste and discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having settled this important business, the newly-mated couple start off
      in quest of a spot for the location of a home. In the case of old birds
      the same locality has been known to be visited for four successive years.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doubtless is the rule where the birds are permitted to obey their own
      natural instincts uninterfered with by beast or man. For obvious reasons,
      these Ducks delight to live in close proximity to bodies of water. Such
      places afford conveniences to the young when they are sufficiently matured
      to betake themselves thither. Situations remote from this element entail
      unnecessary labor upon the female, who is then required, at considerable
      risk and trouble, to carry them one by one in her bill. When the distance
      is not too great, and the ground beneath the tree is well covered with
      dried leaves and grasses, the young scramble to the mouth of the nest,
      drop themselves down, and under the maternal leadership wend their way to
      the much-loved fluid. Often the tree or stub which contains their home is
      found to overshadow the water. All that is necessary then is for the
      tender creatures after reaching the entrance, to spread their
      ill-feathered wings and oar-like feet, and fling themselves down. This
      feat can be performed without jeopardy to life or limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site being agreed upon to the mutual satisfaction of the parties
      concerned, all that is necessary to be done before going to house-keeping,
      is to select a place for the nest. For this purpose, almost any tree, or
      branch thereof, containing the essential hollow, and located reasonably
      near some stream or expanse of water, can be utilized. According to
      Audubon, "the holes to which they betake themselves are either over deep
      swamps, above cane-brakes, or on broken branches of high sycamores, seldom
      more than forty or fifty feet from the water." Our experience, which is
      similar to Wilson's, is that these birds do not have a partiality for any
      particular species. While tree hollows are generally preferred, we have
      the authority of the illustrious personages whose names we have just cited
      for saying that such places are not exclusively chosen. The former claims
      to have met with the home of a pair of these birds in a fissure of a rock,
      along the Kentucky River, only a few miles from Frankfort; and the latter
      speaks of having discovered one which was placed in a fork composed of
      branches, and built out of a few rude sticks. In the South, the forsaken
      retreat of the Gray Squirrel, or the hole of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker,
      are common nesting-places. Often the entrance to the nest is apparently so
      small compared with the bulk of the occupant, that it is a matter of
      surprise to many how she can manage to make her way into it without
      suffering bodily injuries. But she does, which is proof that she knows
      either how to conform to circumstances, or else is a better judge of size
      than many of us would-be-wise lords of creation. All structures which we
      have examined were generally wide enough at the mouth to admit of easy
      passage, and were from four to six feet deep. The bottom of the cavity
      invariably consisted of soft decayed wood, and a few feathers which were
      doubtless plucked by the bird from her own breast. Besides these articles,
      other writers have observed dry plants, down, and feathers of the Wild
      Turkey, Wild Goose, and the common barnyard fowl. The height of the
      entrance above the ground varies from fifteen to thirty feet, according to
      our experience. Possibly a less, or even a greater elevation may sometimes
      be attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson speaks of a nest which he observed in an old grotesque white oak.
      It stood on a slope of one of the banks of the Tuckahoe River, in New
      Jersey, just twenty yards from the water's edge, and had been occupied for
      four consecutive years. At the time of his visit it contained thirteen
      young birds, which the maternal head was engaged in carrying down to the
      water to give them, perhaps, their first experience in the natatorial art.
      So carefully, and yet so adroitly and quickly did she perform this
      seemingly difficult task, that she was less than ten minutes in its
      accomplishment. Although the male usually stands sentry while the diverse
      processes of laying and sitting are going on, and signals the approach of
      enemies by a peculiar cry which has been likened to the crowing of a young
      cock&mdash;<i>oe êêh! oe êêk!</i>&mdash;yet from the silence of one writer
      upon the subject, we infer that the duty of rearing the rather numerous
      family is left to the mother, her proud and consequential partner, as
      though disdaining such ignoble and degrading because slavish work, being
      off with his gay companions, disporting themselves in mid-air, or
      trimming, while perched upon some sheltering bough, their rich and varied
      plumage. So intent, however, was the mother-bird upon the faithful
      discharge of her joyous home-duties, that she heeded not the stately
      sloop, then nearly completed, as it lay upon the stocks close-by, with its
      hull looming up within twelve feet of her home, darkened with the
      presence, and reverberating with the noise of workmen, but continued to
      pass in and out as though unconscious of the so near approach of danger.
      Audubon claims that the male deserts the female when the period of sitting
      commences, and joins his sterner brethren, who unite into flocks of
      considerable numbers, and keep apart from their partners until the young
      are fully matured, when young and old of both sexes come together, and
      thus remain until the return of another breeding-season.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what has been said above, it must be evident to the reader that the
      female is wholly concerned with the duties of incubation. For a little
      more than twenty-one days she is thus occupied, and with nothing to
      relieve the monotony of her task. How often must she despair, and bewail
      the hardship of her lot, no mortal knows. But it is the decree of
      inexorable fate, and most willingly does she bow to it. But the ennui of
      the labor is in a measure forgotten in the vision which hope holds out to
      the patient little housewife. Weary, and well-nigh spent of her strength,
      she persists a little while longer, and her patience and assiduity are
      rewarded. A whole nest-full of happy ducklings gladden her heart, and send
      a new thrill through her being. While the hatching process is going on,
      the loving parent only leaves the nest when pressed by the pangs of
      hunger, and but for a short time. Before leaving, she always takes the
      precaution to see that her treasures are carefully covered with down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young follow the mother the same as our domesticated species do, and
      gather whatever of vegetable and insect food they happen to meet with.
      They are passionately fond of the water, and best show their real nature
      and disposition when gracefully floating upon its glassy surface, or
      diving beneath its liquid depths. At an early age they respond to the
      parent's call with a soft and mellow <i>pee, pee, pee-e</i>, which is
      uttered quite rapidly, and at repeated intervals. The call of the mother,
      when addressing the young, at such times, is rather low and soft, and
      resembles the above sounds, only a little more prolonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      These beautiful birds have often been domesticated. At such times they
      become so unsuspicious and familiar as to allow themselves to be stroked
      upon the back with the hand. Instances are on record. Such being so, what
      is there to prevent the introduction of them into our yards? Nothing. Then
      let it be tried. A glance at the picture will show that no handsomer bird
      could be chosen. Look at the male as he stands upon an embankment on the
      right of the picture ready at any moment, so it seems, to plunge into the
      watery fluid below, and tell us if there is anything more beautiful in the
      world of swimming-birds. We apprehend not. His conspicuous size, some
      nineteen inches in length, and scope of wing of two and one-third inches,
      make him a being of no mean proportions. But then it is the richness and
      variety of his colors that render him an object of attraction. Near the
      farther shore of the pond, with her shadow reflected in the water, like a
      thing of grace, floats his loved but less showy companion. She is nearly
      of the same size as he, but wanting in the same dignity of demeanor. On
      the other side stands an old tree, festooned with vines, which represents
      the nest of these birds, with a female just in the act of entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of the Wood Duck range from six to thirteen to a setting. Their
      shape passes from the ovate form to one that is nearly oval, and, indeed,
      specimens are often found which are almost perfectly elliptical. Eggs from
      Massachusetts measure 1.97 by 1.45 inches. Others from Michigan, 2.21 by
      1.54; and some from Maine, 2.10 by 1.54. A set of ten from Iowa, but
      recently received, of a yellowish-white or creamy color, which seems to be
      the natural hue, are beautifully elliptical in contour, and have an
      average measurement of 2.08 by 1.59 inches; the largest being 2.19 inches
      long, and 1.59 wide, and the smallest, 1.96 in length and 1.63 in width.

      Tit.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Least Tit,
      introduced to the notice of ornithologists by Mr. Townsend in 1837, is
      exclusively a denizen of the country bordering on the Pacific Ocean. It
      inhabits the whole region stretching from Fort Steilacoom, in Washington
      Territory, to Fort Tejon, in California. According to Dr. Garnbel, it is
      not only abundant throughout California, but is also an occupant of the
      Rocky Mountains. But as this author wrote at a period anterior to that
      which marked the separation of this species from its nearest kin&mdash;the
      Plumbeous Tit&mdash;it is believed by Dr. Coues that those nice shades of
      difference which climate or other influences have impressed upon the Rocky
      Mountain birds were unobserved by him, and that he was thus led to
      consider the two species identical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although these birds have been deemed migratory in Washington Territory,
      as the writings of Drs. Cooper and Suckley would lead us to infer, yet
      there is strong evidence for believing that it is not wholly the case.
      From observations made by Mr. Townsend, we learn that they are quite
      common during the winter, and may be seen in great numbers hopping around
      among the bushes, or hanging head downwards from leafless twigs after the
      fashion of other Titmice. While thus engaged in search of the pupa of
      insects, they are very reckless, and keep up a continual twittering. Their
      notes are rapidly enunciated, and have been likened to the words <i>thshish
      tslmt-tsee-twee</i>, the last two syllables bearing a slight resemblance
      to the concluding strains of our Eastern Chickadee.
    </p>
    <p>
      While gleaning for food, these noisy beings go in companies. Troops of
      fifties and sixties, and some say hundreds, travel through the woods, and
      make their otherwise cheerless depths resound with din and chatter. Nor do
      they journey alone, for they are often accompanied by the Kinglets and
      other kindred species. So intent are they upon the procurement of food at
      such times, that they seem utterly unconscious of danger. It is not
      uncommon for a bystander to be so surrounded by one of these flocks as to
      be almost able to capture the birds with the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nuttall, in speaking of this species, affirms that it arrives on the banks
      of the Willamette River, in Oregon, about the fifteenth of May, which
      would lead one to believe that even in this State it is a migrant. As this
      date is about the period of breeding in slightly lower latitudes, may not
      this writer have been somewhat hasty in expressing his opinion? In the
      East, birds that are reputed permanent residents during mild, open
      winters, can be seen in moderate abundance in accustomed haunts, and at
      all times. But let the weather become severe, and there will be a notable
      scarcity of birds. They do not certainly migrate to warmer regions, but
      seek hidden recesses or nooks where they can obtain the necessary shelter
      and protection. A recurrence of warmer days, after a little, soon causes
      them to return to old, familiar haunts, which could not be, had they
      journeyed to lower and semi-tropical climes. Perhaps some such event had
      occurred on the occasion to which Nuttall alludes, or a short time before,
      or the birds, by reason of a paucity of food-stuffs, may have been forced
      to move to adjoining localities in the same latitude, and had just
      returned for purposes of nesting. If such was the case, an eye-witness of
      the scene would be likely to pronounce it a veritable migration, not
      knowing the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whether these birds do actually migrate or not, matters little for
      present purposes. What concerns us most, is their history at the mating
      time. Of this we know little. But not unlike their many kin, the desire
      for food is so strong, that most of the time in early spring is spent in
      its search. The precarious lives which most migratory birds are-forced to
      lead during the unprolific season of the year, when the reign of plenty
      begins, forces them into habits of gormandizing. Life seems to have
      acquired new zest. The collection of food, and its application to the
      wants of the body, exercise supreme control, all other considerations
      being swallowed up thereby. But this cannot last long. Satiety, like
      pleasure, soon o'erdoes itself, and reason comes to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks of such a life are enough. Grown weary of its monotony, and
      surfeited with delights, the flocks now dissolve into pairs. All is now a
      scene of bustle and activity. Actuated by amatory influences, the males
      seek themselves partners, and matrimonial relations are assumed. There is
      good reason to believe that mating happens early during some seasons. Dr.
      Cooper mentions the finding of a nest on the first of March, which would
      lead us to infer that it had occurred during the preceding month. Finished
      structures in our collection from Santa Paula, California, which were
      discovered by Prof. B. W. Evermann, bear the respective dates of April 14
      and 17. Making allowances for building, it is probable that the sexes do
      not pair until the middle or the last of March. Of the precise time we are
      left in darkness. Nor are we the wiser about the general behavior of the
      birds, much less those pleasing little episodes of bird-life which are
      then called into existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having mated, the happy couple start off together in quest of a suitable
      bush or tree in which to build. The live oak, the willow, occasionally the
      mistletoe, and perhaps others, are selected. These structures are
      sometimes suspended from a forked twig, but more generally from a single
      branch. A remarkable peculiarity about their building is the elevation at
      which their dwellings are placed. The height varies from four to eight
      feet, and we cannot find that the latter distance has been exceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few nests, if any, surpass in beauty and comfort the nest of this species.
      It is the most artistic of all pensile structures, and resembles an
      old-fashioned silken purse. In form, texture and finish it is a perfect
      model of architectural design and skill. When we consider its size, the
      durability and smoothness of its outside periphery, and coziness of
      interior, we are lost in wonder and admiration. What ingenuity and
      perseverance are here displayed! It seems almost impossible that such wee
      specimens of the feathered creation could have built such a monument. But
      the naked truth, real and substantial, lies before us. When we contemplate
      this wonderful work of art, we know not whether to admire most the
      indefatigable industry of the builders, or their cunning workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical structure before us is closely and evenly woven of slender
      spears of grass, fine rootlets, fragments of branching and crustaceous
      lichens, small stems, fibrous rootlets, down, vegetable cotton and mosses.
      These substances are pretty regularly distributed, like the colors in a
      carpet, so that the fabric presents uniformity in appearance. The interior
      is lined with down and other soft vegetable materials, producing thereby a
      chamber of which the daintiest Sybarite of the palmy days of Magna Græcia
      would delight to be the proud possessor. Some structures are cozily lined
      with large masses of feathers, which are made to project from the
      entrance, and which, in some instances, become a part of the walls of the
      building itself. Ordinarily, the nest retains the greenish-gray color
      which the mosses and lichens impart to its exterior, long after it has
      been detached from its point of suspension. The length of these fabrics
      varies from six to nine inches. The width is generally three inches, and
      the thickness of the walls, three-fourths of an inch. Inside, the depth
      ranges from four to five inches, according to the length of the structure,
      and width, from seven-eighths to one inch. The entrance is most generally
      near the top, and measures one inch in diameter. The specimen from which
      the drawing is made, is six inches long, nearly cylindrical, with rounded
      extremities, and about three inches in width. The walls are an inch thick,
      and the opening, which is near the top, is exactly one inch in diameter.
      For convenience we were compelled to reduce the dimensions, and put it
      slightly in the background. The female bird, which has a length of 4.30
      inches, and an expanse of wings of 2.15, is proportionally diminished,
      while the male occupies a position in front, and appears with uncurtailed
      proportions. The nest is represented as hanging from a branch, a species
      of cherry, which is popularly known as the soft-leaved cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      We mention, in this connection, a very fine nest of this species, which
      has lately come into our possession, through the kindness of Prof.
      Evermann, of Indiana. This nest was suspended from a branch of the live
      oak, and was discovered on the fifteenth of April, 1880. It is largely
      composed of down, grass-stems and spears of the same, lichens, mosses,
      vegetable down and cotton, on the outside, and is comfortably lined with
      the down and wool of plants. In structure and composition it resembles all
      other nests of this species, but differs therefrom in form and dimensions.
      This beautiful fabric measures twenty-two inches in length, and is
      somewhat shaped like an elongated spindle. It is three inches wide in the
      middle, one and a half at the summit, and two and a half at the base. The
      opening is three-fourths of an inch in diameter, and placed fully five
      inches from the top of the nest. From the entrance to the bottom of the
      chamber, the cavity does not perceptibly widen, but maintains the width at
      the mouth. This affects the thickness of the walls, which is greatest in
      the middle, and least above. But owing to their elasticity, they can be
      made to conform to the volume of either occupant. The depth of the cavity
      is twelve inches. When we consider the size of this nest, it does not seem
      possible that such diminutive specimens of bird-life could have the
      enterprise and courage to enter into such a gigantic project, and the
      patience and perseverance to carry it to completion. Prof. Evermann does
      not inform us whether it was accomplished by the pair of occupants, or by
      them with the assistance of others. Even the ordinary structure is so
      wondrously large compared with the individual bulk of the builders, as to
      suggest to the mind of Dr. Cooper the possibility of its being the result
      of the united labors of an entire flock. What would our worthy friend say
      should he meet with another just like the one we have described? We think
      he would be inclined to attribute it to the labor of several flocks, or
      else imagine it the work of supernatural beings. Such disparity as exists
      between the cyclopean monument before us and the pigmy architects thereof,
      would almost persuade us to one or the other conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      From information gleaned from the recorded observations of others, and
      from personal knowledge of closely-related species, we incline to the
      opinion that these birds manifest a great fondness for their homes, and
      guard them with the most jealous care. Nuttall makes mention of a
      circumstance occurring under his notice, which confirms this belief.
      During one of his excursions, he met with a male-bird, whose overanxiety
      about the safety of the nest induced him to keep a lookout for anything
      that might happen. Following his guide, who, though unwilling to expose
      its whereabouts, was driven to it by an irresistible influence, he came to
      a low bush, where, dangling from a branch, and only about four feet from
      the ground, flashed upon his vision the lovely spectacle. It was a
      beautiful affair, in shape like a long purse, and having a neat circular
      opening near the top which answered for a doorway. The lint of plants,
      moss and down entered into its manufacture, and within there was a soft
      lining of feathers. This nest contained six perfectly white treasures,
      which were only awaiting the mysterious and miraculous powers of a few
      more days, perhaps hours, of heat, to transform them into restless,
      active, yet helpless beings. When a bird is killed, we are told, others
      will gather around it with manifestations of anxiety, calling plaintively
      upon it to follow them in their sports and wanderings. So fearless do they
      become at such times that it is almost possible to take them by the hand.
      Assuredly, such exhibitions of sorrow and solicitude as we have depicted,
      are not only to be met with then, but also, to an infinitely greater
      extent, on those more trying occasions when their homes are about being
      desecrated and despoiled by sacrilegious hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of the Least Tit are quite small, beautifully oval in shape, and
      of a pure, unspotted white color. They slightly vary in dimensions. In a
      set of five which we have before us, the largest measures .57 of an inch
      in length, and .44 in width; the smallest, .56 by .45 inches. The average
      measurement is .57 by .44 of an inch. The number of eggs constituting a
      complement ranges from five to nine. Nothing has been stated in regard to
      the number of broods annually raised, but it is probable the species is
      single-brooded.

      in its migrations, passes from Mexico, Guatemala, and, perhaps, Cuba,
      through the eastern parts of the United States, northward into the British
      Provinces as far as the 50th parallel of latitude, and from the Atlantic
      westward to the valley of the Missouri, where it is replaced by a
      closely-allied species. Throughout New England, the Middle States, and the
      Southern Atlantic region, the Carolinas especially, it is rather abundant,
      and the same may be affirmed of the western limits of its range. In New
      Brunswick and Nova Scotia, lying outside of our possessions, it is met
      with but rarely; whereas, in the vicinity of Montreal, and around
      Hamilton, it is far from being an uncommon summer visitor. There seems to
      be a notable scarcity of birds in Eastern Maine as we approach the
      Canadian territory in the north-east. Why the species should dwindle into
      numbers insignificant as the seaboard is neared, while in the contrary
      direction it is apparently as abundant as in Pennsylvania, it is not our
      province to speak with positiveness. Perhaps the somewhat different
      conditions of soil and climate which prevail in the north-west have much
      to do with this seeming preference. Unlike most species, the subject of
      our sketch will, doubtless, when its history has been as carefully studied
      in every part of its habitat as it has been in the East, be found to breed
      throughout the vast area of its United States range.

      These birds never arrive in old, familiar haunts until the weather has
      assumed the mild, placid demeanor of spring, and everything points to the
      complete vanquishment of the winter-god and his merciless hordes of
      invaders. A chorus of strange, weird voices from the solemn depths of the
      forest-shades, when night has thrown her sable curtain o'er earthly
      landscapes, is the first reminder that we have of their mysterious
      presence. Like an evil genius from the land of dreams they come among us
      to disturb our slumbers by their lugubrious utterances. But in the
      daytime, when all respectable beings, whether beast or man, do most
      delight to be seen and heard, these sylph-like denizens of the air shrink
      away to the uncertain shadows of the grove, where they spend their time in
      sleep, or moody silence, or, mayhap, in the concocting of ways to terrify
      poor, timid human beings. Coming down from these flights of imagination to
      the prose of real life, we may truthfully say, that they "love darkness
      rather than light." From the time of their first appearance during the
      early nights of May until their departure in August or September for the
      Gulf country and the land stretching southward, they maintain the same shy
      and retired disposition, concealing themselves from the glare of
      full-orbed day in close-set forests among fallen leaves and underbrush,
      and only venturing out in quest of food when the sun has sought his rosy
      couch beyond the Western wave. With the setting of the day-star, and the
      stir of the myriads of moths that now make night lively with their
      graceful motions and riotings, these Night-jars, as they are sometimes
      appropriately called, emerge from their hiding-places, and rejoice in
      wanton and luxurious feasting. They are far from being the dull, stupid
      beings which we would have been disposed to designate them only a few
      hours before. They are now all nimbleness and grace. Watch them as they
      sail through the bending, swaying ether as noiselessly as a thistle-down,
      and as lightly as a balloon afloat, and tell us were there ever more
      graceful creatures, and any better adapted to the purposes of their being?
      We apprehend not. What a beautiful and nice adaptation of means to end is
      here exemplified! Being designed and created to hold in check, in common
      with others of their kin, the various and multitudinous swarms of insects
      which fill the nocturnal atmosphere, the Wisdom that never errs has given
      them a peculiar structure, and peculiar habits. They must seek the
      darkness of night, and shun the light of day. And in order to capture
      their prey without startling it, they must move on swift and noiseless
      pinions, and with the greatest caution. Their prey often being large, a
      wide gape of mouth is necessary. Everything, even down to the minutest
      details of structure, declare their eminent fitness for the part which
      they have to play in the <i>role</i> of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a decided partiality has our friend for the lovely woods, that he
      seldom forsakes its time-honored precincts for the open field. The sombre
      shadows cast by the motionless or quivering leaves upon the ground, and
      the melancholy streaks of light which fitfully play through the spaces
      between them, combined with the dark colors of the leaves that repose upon
      the soil beneath, produce a sort of gray and mellow light which
      beautifully harmonizes with the sober tints of these birds, and thus adds
      to their protection. In our travels we have frequently surprised an
      individual in his slumbers only a few paces away. Alarmed at this
      unexpected intrusion, the bird would wing its somewhat uncertain flight on
      swift and noiseless pinions to a place a few hundred feet distant, where
      it would alight upon a branch, or on the ground. After indicating the spot
      by a fallen log, or an adjoining bush, we would stealthily and quietly
      approach the place, straining our vision all the while in hopes of gaining
      a glimpse of the squatting bird. But before the desire could be gratified,
      the object of our search would become apprised of our presence, and take
      to wing. Again and again we have made the attempt to steal upon the bird
      unawares, but it invariably failed in accomplishment, even when the
      greatest caution was observed. The means which these birds employ for the
      detection of danger are both remarkable and wonderful. The visual organs
      being ill-suited to the bright light of day, and even the mellowed glow of
      the woods being seemingly too powerful a stimulus, it certainly depends
      upon other functions than those of sight. The sense of hearing being
      well-developed, may not this function be called into requisition at such
      times?
    </p>
    <p>
      The common appellation of this species is derived from the cry which it
      emits at night. This cry has a slight resemblance to <i>whip-poor-will</i>,
      but, by a fertile fancy, it can be construed into a variety of sounds. The
      syllables are rapidly enunciated only when the bird is squatting on a bush
      or fence, or any other object near the ground, but never while in flight.
      It is always heard at night. As the day begins to dawn, it measurably
      diminishes in frequency and intensity, and finally ceases altogether. The
      absence of song while on the wing may be accounted for by the fact that
      the birds are such vigorous feeders, and are so absorbed with the business
      before them, that they have neither the time nor the disposition to
      indulge in such pastime. Besides, the wide-open position of the mouth
      which is assumed while sailing through the air, is hardly one which would
      favor a free exercise of the vocal powers. When in a restful state, the
      cry is perhaps the call which the sexes address to each other, or it may
      be interpreted sometimes as the signal for the resumption of the night's
      carousal after the day-sleep is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly two weeks after their appearance the sexes, although already
      paired, continue to sleep the daylight away, and spend the nighttime in
      feasting and revelling. It is not until the middle of May that they become
      alive to the business which has called them from the land of the agave and
      loblolly-tree. With due diligence, and with but little time spent in
      preliminaries, they seek themselves out a spot for a home, where they
      construct, if at all, the merest apology of a nest. By a prostrate and
      decayed log, usually where the deepest shadow prevails, the female is wont
      to deposit her eggs. A slight concavity is ordinarily scooped out by her,
      in Eastern Pennsylvania, and lined with decayed wood or dried leaves. In
      other localities, and, to some extent, in the writer's own State, she does
      not even go to this trouble, but deposits her treasures, without
      thought-of what she is doing, upon the ground. Whether they rest upon a
      few loose leaves, or on the bare earth, is all the same to her. Having
      chosen her humble home, the female begins immediately to lay her first
      egg. This is followed on the ensuing day by another, and this completes
      her nest-complement. Incubation is at once assumed by the lady-bird, and
      seems to be her exclusive business for the space of fourteen or fifteen
      days. While she is thus occupied during the day, her illustrious partner
      is seldom to be seen, although it is possible that he is generally at no
      great distance from the spot, quietly preparing for the night's
      adventures. Perhaps he is then more considerate, and either sits upon the
      nest while his wife is away in quest of food, or else acts the part of an
      affectionate and indulgent husband, and conveys to her lonely chamber the
      necessary food wherewith to strengthen her for the trying duty which she
      is engaged in performing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few mothers manifest greater love for their children. She will often
      imperil her own life in their behalf. Her vigilance is wonderful, and the
      stratagems she practises to draw intruders away from her eggs and young
      are almost unsurpassed by those of any of our feathered species, excepting
      the female Maryland Yellow-Throat. On an occasion of disturbance her
      actions are strange and curious. She flutters as if mounded, beats the
      ground with her wings as though unable to rise, and performs these
      movements so successfully as to deceive the most wary and experienced
      collector. While thus seeking to divert attention from her home, she has
      even been known to spirit her young away when danger seemed imminent. Mr.
      Wilson cites a case that came under his own observation. This writer once
      set to work to delineate a young bird. Having accomplished the desired
      object, he left the spot, and, on missing his pencil, retraced his steps.
      On arriving thither, to his great surprise he discovered that the young
      bird had been carried away to a place of safety, but by what means, he
      doubtless never learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young leave the nest when they are about seven days old, and are then
      able to move with considerable swiftness. At brief intervals, while
      nestlings, they utter a low, plaintive note, which has been likened by
      Nuttall to the syllables <i>pé-ugh</i>. A fortnight longer at home, under
      the guardianship of the maternal head, prepares them for the stern
      realities and cold charities of the outside world. They are now able to
      supply themselves with food, although still members of the same household.
      At first their food consists of caterpillars which are procured by the
      parents from the leaves and branches of trees. The different species of
      measuring-worms, and mature forms of noctuids and tineids among
      lepidoptera, constitute a considerable portion of their diet. But as they
      grow older, and are able to feed themselves, they devour immense numbers
      of ants and grasshoppers. When first hatched, in their helplessness, they
      depend for safety upon the close similarity which obtains between them and
      their immediate surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species are elliptical, being nearly or quite equal at
      both extremities. The ground-color is a pure creamy-white, and is
      irregularly scratched and marbled all over with reddish-brown and
      purplish-lavender lines and blotches, the former predominating. There is
      considerable variation in the intensity of coloration, some specimens
      being heavily marked, while others, from the faintness of the tracery,
      appear bleached or faded. Eggs from New England measure from 1.21 to 1.26
      inches in length, and from .75 to .78 in width; from the Middle States
      they average 1.26 by .89; while specimens from the South and the
      North-west offer no material differences in many particulars these eggs
      resemble those of the Chuck-will's-widow, but are purer and more
      beautiful. There is also a notable resemblance to the eggs of the two
      European Goatsuckers, which is what the real scientist would naturally
      expect. In the drawing, the eggs are represented the natural size, and by
      the side of a fallen log. The male is considerably reduced, and may be
      readily distinguished from his partner by the white collar of the throat,
      and by his larger size. He measures ten inches in length, and has an
      expanse of wings of six and a half inches. The female is proportionally
      diminished, and is characterized by a light fulvous gorget, and in the
      absence of the white patch of the tail.

      somewhat restricted in its distribution. In this respect it differs from
      its numerous congeneric brethren, which have a wide dispersion. It is
      chiefly a denizen of the eastern parts of the United States, and of the
      British territory immediately adjacent thereto. Fort Rice, in
      North-western Dakota, according to Coues, and Kansas and Nebraska in the
      west, seem to be the limits of its range in those directions. Although
      notable for its scarcity in regions beyond the Mississippi, Iowa excepted,
      yet it abundantly compensates therefore as we advance eastward. In the
      Middle and Eastern States they are probably found in greater numbers than
      elsewhere. While the greater bulk pass north to breed, some abide in the
      South, and raise their happy little families, in spite of the ardor of the
      climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few species, if any, arrive earlier. It generally appears from the fifth
      to the tenth of March in New England and the Middle Atlantic States,
      although instances are known where birds have been observed as early as
      the twenty-fourth of February. These cases are, however, rare, and only
      happen, if at all, when the weather has been remarkably propitious for a
      lengthy spell. As a few of them have been known to remain all winter in
      Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, when the season has been fine, may not their
      emergence from sheltered localities, at such times, be construed by
      persons who are not cognizant of their presence, or of their occasional
      disposition to permanence of residence, as but a case of recent arrival?
      In view of this latter habit, it would be difficult to prove that the
      visitor had just come from the South, unless it had been discerned <i>in
      transitu.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Having decided upon their migratory tour, they start in small companies,
      from four to six in number. These settle down in small tracts of country
      of a few rods in area on reaching their destination. Low, swampy thickets
      generally invite their presence. Here they conceal themselves during the
      day. But when night has dethroned her rival, and temporarily assumed the
      reins of power, they come out of their grassy retreats, and wander about
      in search of food. The setting of the sun behind the western hill-tops is
      the signal for their nocturnal rambles to begin. And well do they keep
      them up. For it is not until the first streak of morning is seen to glow
      in the East that they abandon their foragings and retire to accustomed
      haunts. Few there are who have visited these birds at such times. Let us
      take our readers to yon neighboring swamp, or by the side of some lowly
      woodland, which these strange beings delight to frequent. The utmost
      silence must be maintained, or our friends will be frightened away. While
      we may not be able to see the objects that have called us hither, we know
      they are not far away by the rustle which they produce among the dry
      leaves, and by the peculiar notes which they emit, for there are two or
      three individuals together, as they move restlessly about in the
      undergrowth, in their search for worms. <i>Chip-per, chip-per, chip</i>
      may be heard from the right, and almost in the next instant it is varied
      to <i>bleat</i> or <i>bleat ta bleat ta</i>, produced in the contrary
      direction, or off in the distance, showing that the authors thereof have
      changed their positions. While these birds have an habitual fondness for
      humid thickets, they not unfrequently betake themselves to corn-fields and
      other cultivated tracts in close proximity thereto, and even to elevated
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than a fortnight after their arrival the sexes, though feeding in
      company, do not apparently manifest a disposition to assume conjugal
      relationship. The desire for food seems to be uppermost in their minds.
      The inclemency of the weather, and the coldness of the ground in
      consequence, may have much to do with holding the amatory forces in check.
      But when the opportune moment arrives, which it does in the course of
      events, the sexes stop from their feeding, in a measure, and give the
      nobler instincts of their being a chance for development. The males are
      the first to feel the changes which are being wrought in their natures.
      For more than a week from this time, in the early morning and evening
      hours, they may be seen exercising themselves by means of "curious spiral
      gyrations" in mid-air, and uttering, as they descend earthwards, a note
      which Audubon lias likened to the word <i>kwank</i>. This note may be a
      call for the female in the spring, but as it is often uttered in the fall
      after the breed-ing-season is past, it may also be a summons for the
      gathering together of the members of the same household. The production of
      these sounds seems to be a labor of much effort. The movements of the bird
      then, must be seen to be appreciated. The head and bill are bent forward
      until the latter comes into contact with the ground, and, just as the
      sound is being emitted, the body is urged violently forward. These
      spasmodic exertions being over, the actor in this drama, twitches its
      abbreviated, halfspread tail, assumes an erect attitude of listening, and,
      if no response is elicited, repeats its characteristic cry, with all the
      accompanying movements. If the call awakes an answering note, the happy
      lover flies to the presence of the one he seeks, and lavishes upon her the
      most endearing caresses. Sometimes, as Audubon affirms, the male awaits
      the arrival of the loved one, and does not fly to meet her. According to
      the same authority, the summons seems sometimes to be replied to by one of
      the same sex, which is always the prelude to a fierce encounter between
      the two, for, on these occasions, when the feelings are in a high state of
      tension, the utmost enmity exists between the males. These contentions are
      usually shortlived, and cease with the assumption of matrimonial
      relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happiness of the male is now complete. With his homely, but,
      doubtless, to him, prepossessing bride, by his side, he soon journeys off
      in search of a home. This is a matter of some consequence, and tasks the
      patience to the utmost. But their labors in this direction are eventually
      crowned with success. They frequent the most secluded resorts, and hide
      their nest away in some low, dense and swampy woods or brake, difficult of
      access, and one that none but the cruel collector would be likely to
      visit. The nest is generally placed on the ground, at the foot of a bush
      or tussock, in the midst of small birches or alders, or on a decayed stump
      or prostrate log. In some localities it is snugly nestled in the midst of
      a meadow. It is not an elaborate affair by any means, but merely consists
      of a few dried leaves or grasses which are scratched together by the
      female&mdash;the work of a few hours at the most.
    </p>
    <p>
      The domicile being ready for occupancy, the female soon commences to
      deposit her beautiful treasures. One by one they are laid on consecutive
      days, until her complement of three or four is reached. In the Southern
      States, oviposition commences in March or February, while in the northern
      limits of the range of this species, from the tenth to the fifteenth of
      April; seldom later. Incubation is mutual, and so attentive are the birds
      to the task, that it is an unusual occurrence to find them both absent
      therefrom at the same time. When the female is sitting, her partner
      improves the time by attending to the demands which hunger makes upon him.
      The same is true of the female when she has resigned her charge to the
      care of her noble and conscientious lord. So faithfully do they keep to
      the nest, that nothing but the most menacing danger will compel them to
      quit it. The approach of a team, or of a pedestrian, within a foot of it,
      has not been known to startle them. But when the danger is quite imminent,
      the sitting-bird slips out of it, and makes its way into the tall grasses,
      at some distance therefrom, and becomes a silent and sorrowful witness of
      the disaster to be accomplished. Should no destruction be perpetrated, and
      the intruder has gone his way, it cautiously comes out of its
      hiding-place, and resumes labors. But it has learned a lesson by this
      experience. For on a second visit to the same spot, no bird is to be
      found. Apprised of approaching danger, it has slipped out of the nest in
      time to escape detection. Thus patiently, persistently, and seemingly
      unweariedly, these faithful beings, by turns, apply themselves to the
      task, until success has crowned their willing labors. The time spent in
      hatching, under the most favorable circumstances, varies from seventeen to
      eighteen days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are very timid creatures, and keep close to their parents, who
      manifest considerable solicitude for their well-being. They watch over
      their helpless infancy, so to speak, with a care which a human mother only
      knows, and when their lives are imperiled, resort to many a <i>ruse</i> to
      deceive their enemies, and bring them into places of safety. By a peculiar
      alarm, when severely pressed, the mother warns them of the condition of
      things, and while they are scattering in different directions, she seeks
      to attract attention to herself in many a well-feigned artifice. After the
      danger is past, by a familiar call she summons them together, and
      doubtless relates to them the story of her adventures, and the dangers to
      which they were exposed. Their food consists of worms, animalcula, ants
      and other soft-bodied insects, which the parents assist them in procuring
      from the soft earth, and beneath the grass and dead leaves that abound in
      the places which they frequent. Later on, they are able to obtain their
      subsistence with the address of older birds, by thrusting their bills into
      the soil, and in such other places as would be likely to contain the
      objects desired. Their tongues being covered with a viscid saliva, the
      food adheres thereto, and is drawn into the mouth without danger of
      being-lost. Gunners, as well as those who have made these birds a study,
      have often met with holes which have been made in the soft mud by their
      bills. The presence of these "borings," as they are called, is always
      considered as an indication that game is not very far distant, which a
      thorough exploration of the surrounding country soon reveals to be the
      fact. The young having thoroughly matured, continue in the same haunts
      with their parents, and, unless brought to an untimely death by the
      merciless gun of the hunter, repair to the warm, sunny, smiling South with
      the return of frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species are less pyriform than waders' mostly are, being,
      in some instances, almost ovoidal. Their ground-color varies from a light
      clay to one of buffy-brown, and the markings occur in the form of fine
      spots and blotches of chocolate-brown, interspersed with others of obscure
      lilac, scattered more or less thickly over the surface of the egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Dr. Coues, their size and intensity of color bear, in
      general, a direct correspondence with the depth of the background. In
      Massachusetts these eggs exhibit remarkable variation, passing from 1.45
      to 1.80 inches in length, and from 1.15 to 1.25 in width. Out of a
      collection of a dozen specimens, Dr. Coues found the shortest and broadest
      egg to measure 1.40 by 1.20, and the longest, narrowest one, 1.55 by 1.15
      inches. A set of three before us, from Pennsylvania, has an average
      measurement of 1.54 by 1.21 inches. In the Middle States, and the same is
      doubtless true of other sections of our great country, there is never more
      than a single brood raised, although the early breeding of the species
      would certainly give ample time for a second hatching before the close of
      the season. The drawing shows not merely the eggs <i>in situ</i>, although
      considerably reduced, but at the same time gives a beautiful and accurate
      figure of a typical specimen, alone and isolated. The female is
      represented as standing in the vicinity of the nest, while her partner
      occupies a sitting posture in the foreground of the picture. The total
      length of this species, from tip of bill to extremity of tail, is eleven
      inches. The wing has a stretch of two and a quarter inches. So well have
      the birds been portrayed by the artist, that we shall not attempt a
      description.

      Diver.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>hiefly a boreal
      species, especially during the breeding-season, the Red-throated Diver is
      only known to visit us during the winter. On our eastern sea-board it
      seldom attains a lower latitude than Maryland, while in the West it has
      been met with along the coast as far south as San Diego, California.
      Farther north, however, on the shore-line, around the inlets of Washington
      Territory adjacent to the British possessions, it is more abundant.
      Although of rare occurrence along the Atlantic coast of the United States
      (and it is mostly the young and immature birds that are to be seen) yet in
      Arctic regions the species meets with the essential conditions of soil and
      climate which render life a pleasure, and not a burden. Consequently, the
      birds abound in great numbers, and carry on their worldly affairs
      unexposed to the dangers which would most likely affect them in less
      severe localities that are the common resorts of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most of its kin, this Diver is seen to the best advantage in winter.
      Here several may be seen together, when the weather is favorable, moving
      lightly over the surface of the sea by means of their broad seallike
      paddles, with gently-curving neck and flashing eyes, and on the <i>qui
      vive</i> for whatever of life may stir in the depths below. But let some
      luckless sprat cross the keen-sighted vision of one of these birds, and
      its whole demeanor becomes changed. It is now no longer the peaceful bird
      pursuing its way leisurely over the waters, but the terror of the finny
      tribes. Like an arrow, it darts downward, and with marvellous swiftness,
      urged by its powerful webbed feet and wings, it shoots through the limpid
      fluid, and by means of one fell stroke of its strong-pointed bill,
      transfixes its victim and rises to the surface again. With a gentle shiver
      of the body, the thousand drops of water that adhere to its sleek plumage,
      like spangled dew-drops upon glittering grass-spears, fly in every
      direction, leaving the feathers as dry as if the bird had never taken this
      sub-aqueous journey. Divested of its borrowed jewels, it now prepares to
      enjoy its well-won and precious morsel. For this purpose, with a peculiar
      jerking movement, the prey is swallowed, head foremost, and while the
      process of digestion is going forward, the perpetrator of this late
      sanguinary deed settles down into quiet life, or pursues, with majestic
      and dignified mien, its customary movement athwart the glassy bosom of the
      deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although affecting great fondness for the sea, yet, when awakened to a
      true sense of its being by the unseen forces of Nature, and the amatory
      feelings have become aroused, it bids a temporary adieu thereto, and seeks
      some small, sequestered island in the midst of a lake or pond of fresh
      water, in close proximity to the ocean, where it places its nest. The
      sexes enter into this business with due consideration and dispatch, and
      apparently waste but few precious moments in the indulgence of idle
      fancies, or in the gratification of cherished whims. There is little of
      the heartlessness and fickleness shown by the wooed when her wooer makes
      his suit, as characterize many of our land denizens. The male, tired of
      the utter aimlessness of the social life which he has been leading,
      retires from the scenes once so dear, seeks his mate, doubtless the
      partner of former joys and sorrows, and leads her to the hymeneal altar a
      willing bride. A few mutual recognitions of love, and the happy pair are
      sealed for another season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their chief concern now seems to be the establishment of a home. This is a
      work of short duration. A few blades of rank grass, hastily gathered in
      the neighborhood, are brought together, and, by the joint labors of both
      birds, are circularly arranged, and made to subserve the necessary
      purposes. The nest is very shallow, quite bulky, and well hidden by the
      surrounding verdure. There is always noticeable a lack of down or of
      feathers, which so many sea-birds are accustomed to utilize for warmth and
      concealment. Well-beaten paths may be seen diverging from the nest, which
      the birds follow in going to and returning from the same. When either
      desires to go' thither, it is never known to resort to flight, as this
      would apparently betray its whereabouts. But the object desired is gained
      by a safer method. The bird swims quietly around the nest, carefully
      reconnoitres the spot, and if the land is free from peril, crawls silently
      out of the water and waddles her way up to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By reason of the severity of northern winters, as is usually the case with
      most birds that breed in Labrador and kindred regions the subject of our
      sketch is necessarily compelled to delay nesting until the close of May,
      or the beginning of June. By this time the sun has nearly attained the
      limit of his course in this direction, and his influence is begun to be
      felt with considerable force. The female is not long in occupying the rude
      domicile with her small complement of two or three eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the duty of incubation, which closely follows that of laying, the male
      does not shirk the responsibility, and seek the companionship of others of
      the same sex to while away the hours in piscatorial diversions, but, gallant
      knight that he is, he never forsakes his mate, unless called away by
      hunger. He is ever ready to respond to her call, and assumes the charge of
      the house and its precious, undeveloped inmates, with cheerfulness. The
      period of incubation has never been determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young from the first are active creatures, and take to the water
      almost as soon as they are hatched. On their first introduction to this
      fluid they prove themselves to be equally expert both in swimming and in
      diving. Few parents are more solicitous for the safety of their progeny.
      When assailed by dangers, they watch over them with assiduous care, and
      lead them in many a devious route through the watery waste, and inculcate
      into their minds many a bit of information and advice which could not be
      better taught otherwise. The young profit by these teachings by example,
      and soon become as shy and vigilant as their illustrious parents. In their
      fresh-water home, they feed upon snails, leeches, shrimps, small fish and
      aquatic insects. But after they have betaken themselves to the sea, they
      discard, in a measure, such small fry, and seek larger game, as they sport
      freely and lustily about in the exuberance of happy spirits. They are not
      long in acquiring their full stature, and in rendering themselves
      acquainted with the vocabulary of their parents. The vocal expressions of
      the latter are harsh and loud, and may be aptly represented by the
      syllables <i>cac, cac, carah, carah</i>, delivered in rapid succession.
      The birds are slow, however, in obtaining their full plumage. This does
      not occur until the fourth year of their existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species differ from those of the Loon, a near cousin,
      chiefly in size; being somewhat smaller. They pass from an oval form to
      one that is ovate, and, in some instances, are rather elongated. Their
      general color is an olivaceous-brown, although specimens sometimes show a
      decided tendency to olivaceous-drab. We have seen others whose primary
      color was of a reddish-brown order. Scattered over the ground-color, but
      mainly about the larger extremity, spots of black or dark-brownish,
      varying in size from a pin-point to an eighth of an inch, may be found
      more or less abundantly. A clutch of two before us from Greenland are
      olivaceous-brown tending slightly to drab, and are marked with blackish
      spots of varying sizes. They measure respectively 3.13 and 3.07 inches in
      length, and 1.88 and 1.75 inches in diameter, giving a mean average
      measurement of 3.10 by 1.82 inches. In the cut they are figured as large
      as they appear in nature, and in the foreground. The birds are faithfully
      delineated as to colors and markings, but show considerable diminution in
      size. In the natural state, the male has a length of twenty-seven, and a
      wing-expanse of eleven and a half inches; the bill and tail each being two
      and a quarter inches. The female is a trifle smaller than her partner,
      weighing, on an average, about a pound less. Her plumage is the exact
      counterpart of his, or differs in no material particulars therefrom.

      breath of spring, on zephyr wings, blows over the South, laden with dewy
      moisture and balm from regions beyond the Gulf, this tiny speck of
      bird-life feels the glowing influence, and hails it with delight. Weary
      and restless, it seeks to break away from its winter-home, or change the
      monotony of its existence. While some are inclined to newness of climate,
      and leisurely wend their way northward, others are happy and contented
      where they are. Those, imbued with a spirit of migration, quit their less
      ambitious neighbors in March or April, to spend their summers abroad. All
      reach their destination by three great routes. Those on the east, that
      winter in the isles to the southward, follow the trend of the great
      Atlantic slope as far north as the valley of the Connecticut and kindred
      latitudes. Others, doubtless, from our southernmost States and the Mexican
      possessions, pursue a central direction, one part passing through the
      eastern half of the Mississippi Valley to the Lake country, and the other
      ceasing from their toilsome journey when the northern frontiers of
      Nebraska and Iowa are attained. While the western wave, so to speak,
      collect from their winter-retreats in the valleys of the Colorado and Rio
      Grande Rivers and follow these streams to their headwaters, or turn aside
      from their course and make their way through the fertile slopes of the
      Pacific to the latitude of 42 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though an early migrant, yet, by reason of the tardiness of its movements,
      this species does not arrive in the Middle States until the last of April,
      or the beginning of May. In Maryland and Virginia, according to Coues, its
      advent occurs during the early part of April. The Carolinas, Northern
      Alabama and Tennessee witness its appearance about the fifteenth of March
      when the season is not retarded by a long, cold winter, and the Northern
      Central States, towards the close of the ensuing month, which, by some
      inexplicable cause, seems also to be the date of its coming in the great
      Colorado Basin.

      Appearing at a time when the trees are beginning to clothe themselves in
      shimmering robes of green, and often before the oaks and hickories have
      burst their tumid buds into the rich drapery of foliage which is to cover
      their unsightly nakedness, our little friend is none the less welcome.
      From the tall tree-tops we are first made aware of his presence by the
      shrill, wiry notes with which he salutes the morn, and which he is
      accustomed to utter during the livelong day as he moves in and out among
      the branches in tireless pursuit of prey. Not a tree-crevice escapes his
      keen scrutiny. While thus eagerly prying into every cranny or crack that
      meets his gaze in quest of the lurking culprit, should the buzz of a fly
      or the hum of a beetle be borne to his hearing, in an instant he is off
      with a dash that is wonderful to behold, and the unhappy insect is made to
      repent the folly and temerity of its action. At such times, his behavior
      seems to be all hurry and bustle, as though the work of a life must be
      crowded into a few short days.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have but pictured to the minds of our readers the selfish side of his
      character, as manifested in the uncontrollable rapacity which sways him.
      But when the finer and more ennobling impulses of his nature, stimulated
      by returning warmth, have once more gained the mastery, a milder grace
      attends his every movement, and sweeter accents attune his voice. We no
      longer hear those peculiar sounds, which to the human ear resemble <i>tsee-tsee-tsee</i>,
      repeated in rapid succession, and which, a few short weeks before, were
      everywhere to be heard&mdash;a fit accompaniment to his reckless life&mdash;but
      instead, are regaled with the sweetest, tenderest music. This is so low,
      that to appreciate its effect, the auditor must be but a few yards distant
      from the tree which our modest vocalist has selected to be the scene of
      his endeavors. So well sustained is the effort, and, above all, so
      faultlessly rendered, that the most austere critic could hardly fail to
      assign the performer a high place among the feathered choir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many of his kith, he does not seek the bare branch of some tall tree,
      where he can be seen, and thrill the air of vale and wood around with
      ear-splitting utterances. He despises such notoriety. Hid away in the
      leafy canopy that wreathes the brow of some gnarled oak, he loves to take
      his stand, and there pour out his soul in all the ecstasy of subdued song.
      Unpretentious as his music may be, and undervalued for its lack of force
      by the vast choir of singers around, yet it has a depth of power and
      feeling, which, as it is borne aloft upon the bosom of the gentle air,
      strikes the ears of some timid, modest creature, and startles the
      slumbering chords of her being into harmony. Life to her now acquires new
      vitality and enjoyment. With heart beating high with rapturous emotions,
      and urged by an irresistible desire, she betakes herself on swiftest
      pinions to the spot whence emanate the sounds. As she nears it, the music
      comes to her with fuller distinctness, and sends the heart-throbs
      following one another in happy, swift succession. The singer does not
      abate his efforts, but keeps them up with scarce an intermission, until
      they elicit a response, or the gentle, loving one is wafted to his
      immediate presence. On the reception of a reply, his movements are
      restless and animated. But let the object of his thoughts but flit before
      his excited vision, and in a moment he is by her side. In a variety of
      actions which, from a human standpoint, seem meaningless and frivolous, he
      conveys to her his love, and the boundless appreciation of her worth. This
      done, he next attempts a song, which seems to soothe her hitherto agitated
      feelings, and awakens confidence and resignation. He is not slow in
      perceiving the advantage thus acquired, and, consequently, follows it up
      with other advances, which completely place her at the disposal of his
      mercy and power. Conquered at last, she yields herself a willing subject
      to the potency of love, and becomes his wedded wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The selection of a home-spot now claims the attention. High, open woods
      are preferred for this purpose, although trees along the borders of
      streams, and in low, damp situations, are sometimes chosen. There seems to
      be no particular fancy for one tree more than another, provided it be
      lichen-clad. Those whose branches are thus ornamented, the oak especially,
      will be found to be more frequently favored. Instances are known, however,
      of nests being placed upon the maple, a tree remarkable for its dearth of
      such vegetation. Having chosen the site, the erection of a dwelling is
      next in order. Accordingly, the pair set about this business.
    </p>

      The time chosen for the work is generally the month of May, when
      insect-life runs riot, and mother earth is ablaze with a thousand floral
      beauties, the free-will offering of the queen that now presides. From its
      dawn to its close, these curious structures may be seen in various stages
      of completion, with eggs and without, tenantless and occupied. Specimens
      from Texas, with egg-complements, have been found on or near the
      fifteenth, which had doubtless been commenced two weeks before. Others
      from New Jersey and Pennsylvania contained incubated eggs as late as the
      twenty-eighth, while one from Eastern Tennessee with two fresh eggs was
      found on the sixth of the month following. But this may have been a case
      where the early efforts of the birds to nest had been prevented by
      circumstances beyond their control. Reports from the extreme northern and
      western limits of the range of these birds point to the same conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The height which these nests occupy above the ground varies with the
      locality. In some places they seldom attain a greater elevation than ten
      feet, but, in the majority of cases, this limit is exceeded, and the
      heights of fifty, and even sixty feet, are reached. There is less
      variation in form noticeable, their shape being generally that of a
      truncated cone. One nest before us from the South differs somewhat from
      this figure, and may be pronounced as inversely conical. The position,
      too, is quite uniform. Most of them are placed among slender branches, to
      which they are woven by the ingenuity of the architects, and, although
      non-pensile, are the sport of every breeze. But so securely are they
      fastened, that to dislodge them from their moorings, is a matter of no
      little difficulty.

      Though jostled most readily by the winds, and in danger of destruction,
      yet, by a wise provision of instinct, their contents are insured against
      accident. This is prevented not so much by the depth of the cavity, as by
      the purse-like contraction of the rim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few structures of bird-architecture are more handsome than the home of
      this little Gnatcatcher, and none so worthily excite our wonder and
      admiration. Like the nests of the Humming-bird and Wood Pewee, it is a
      perfect model of beauty and design. So cunningly contrived a structure,
      and one so comfortably, durably and tastefully arranged, would doubtless
      be attributed by us to the work of superior beings, were we not acquainted
      with the artificers. In the foregoing particulars, it stands almost
      unrivalled. Like the colors which glow upon the bosom of the mother of
      pearl, it must be seen to be fully appreciated. No description, however
      faithfully portrayed, can give an adequate conception of its beauty. But
      we shall make the attempt. Even the picture gives but a meagre idea of the
      elegance of this cosy chamber. Its walls are of felt, closely and
      compactly woven, and made of slender stems of grass, the down of thistles,
      spider's webs, and vegetable-like fibres. As if dissatisfied with such a
      fine piece of mechanism, our little architects must needs go further. With
      a love for the beautiful and picturesque, they almost startle the beholder
      by investing the exterior with a fine stucco-work of bluish-gray lichens
      which serves the two-fold purpose of ornamentation and protection. So like
      a natural excrescence does the nest now appear, that only the experienced
      eye can detect the 'difference. Compared with the size of its tiny
      builder, who measures but four and three-tenths inches from tip of bill to
      caudal extremity, the nest seems bulky. These structures are, however, by
      no means uniform in size. A specimen from New Jersey has a width of two
      and seven-eighths inches, and a height of three. Another from Texas
      measures two and five-eighths inches in length, and but two and a half in
      external diameter. The smallest we have seen are from Tennessee and
      California. The former has a width of two and a quarter inches, and a
      height of two and five-eighths, while the latter differs therefrom only in
      length, being half an inch less. The cavities offer less striking
      differences, varying slightly from one and a half inches in either
      direction. In composition the Western nest presents some points of
      difference. The exterior is composed of yellowish-green and greenish-gray
      lichens, specifically distinct from Eastern specimens, a slight
      intersprinkling of brown catkins, feathers, cobwebs, and small bits of
      vegetable stems. The inside does not present much variation, but is lined
      with feathers, horse-hairs and vegetable wool, as many of our own are.
      When feathers are utilized for a lining, the quills are generally placed
      in the walls of the nest, only the soft plume-like parts being allowed to
      come into contact with the eggs. The nest from California was found by
      Prof. Ever-mann, in the vicinity of Santa Paula, during the summer of
      1881. It is the prettiest, as well as the most elaborately perfected nest
      which we have yet seen. The one from which the drawing was made, while
      less artistic, deserves mention, from the peculiar position which it
      occupies, being wedged in between two diverging branches from a sweet-gum,
      and fastened thereto by cobwebs passing from its outside to the wing-like
      expansions of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such finished and complicated structures are assuredly not the work of a
      few hours, but the labor of unwearied perseverance and industry upon the
      part of the builders for a week. No division of the work is allowed, but
      each bird toils as suits its inclination. Whether the rearing of the
      fabric proper with its finely-felted walls, or the laying on of the tiles
      afterwards, requires the longer time to accomplish, it is difficult to
      say. Our experience teaches that the latter is the more trying and
      difficult task, and consumes one-third more time. It must not be presumed
      that the builders work steadily through the entire day. This is not the
      case. Rest, recreation, and the procurement of food, are matters that
      require attention, and prolong the labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished their home, the female is not slow in providing it with
      tenants. From four to six eggs are deposited in as many days, and
      incubation entered into. This lasts fourteen days, and is as much the work
      of one sex as the other. While thus occupied, the birds are jealous of
      their property, and resent all intrusions with a valor worthy of
      admiration. This is especially the case when their home is visited by the
      Cowbird. So determined and fierce are the attacks which they wage against
      these birds, that in the <i>melee</i> which ensues, their fragile home is
      often entirely destroyed. In Cooke County, Texas, where this Gnatcatcher
      is abundant, fully half the nests that have been found by Mr. Ragsdale,
      the narrator of this fact, are despoiled before completion, and, in many
      instances, completely obliterated. But let the intruder be some
      conscienceless collector, knowing that resistance is useless the birds do
      not make a stand, but seek some safe spot where they can observe the
      proceedings. But as soon as the premises have been deserted they return,
      and if the home remains untouched, resume possession as though nothing had
      happened. In the event of desecration, they forsake the spot with sorrow
      and reluctance, and try their fortunes elsewhere. But a single brood is
      raised, although the tardiness of some pairs to nidificate has led to the
      belief that in some seasons the species may be double-brooded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young birds, for a week or ten days subsequent to hatching, are quite
      weak and tender, and but for the attention and care bestowed by parental
      love, would quickly perish. Endowed by Nature with vigorous appetites, and
      being blessed with kind and thoughtful parents, they are soon able to help
      themselves. Their food at first consists of larvæ of various kinds, but
      chiefly those of a lepidopterous character, and small diptera. With age
      comes an increase in the quantity and character of their food, and at the
      age of four weeks they desert the home-shelter, and forage in common with
      their parents. Thus they spend their lives, careless and happy, until the
      first appearance of the "sere and yellow leaf" in September warns them of
      the growing scarcity of food-stuffs, and bids them retire to the groves of
      our southernmost States, or to scenes beyond the Mexic line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eggs are oval in form, and slightly pointed. In ground-color they
      are white, and spotted and blotched with reddish-brown, slate and lilac.
      Cabinet specimens, however, show sometimes a faint bluish- or
      greenish-white tint. The markings, though varying considerably, are
      uniformly distributed. In size, there is noticeable but little variation
      in specimens from diverse localities; eggs from Michigan differing but
      slightly from those from Texas, and these sustaining the same' relation to
      sets from Pennsylvania. The average dimensions of a clutch of four from
      New Jersey are .59 by .48 inches. The depth of the nest precludes us from
      showing the eggs <i>in situ</i>. We are therefore compelled to give a
      drawing below, which will be found to be of the natural proportions. The
      female-bird, which is placed in close contiguity to the nest, may be
      easily distinguished from her mate, by the absence of black upon the head.

      brilliancy of coloring none of our North American finches can compare with
      the one which constitutes the subject of this sketch. The euphonious
      French title by which it is designated has been most aptly chosen. For,
      verily, it is the nonpareil of avian beauty. Nature seems to have spared
      no pains in making this her handiwork the perfection of artistic design
      and ornamentation. Such an array of colors, and the beautiful harmony
      which characterizes their blending, bespeak no mean, unskilful painter,
      but a master-hand, before whose paltriest, weakest efforts the noblest of
      man's productions sinks into insignificance.

    <p>
      Contrasted with its less showy associates that frequent the same
      delightful, sunny landscapes to breed, this lovely species seems
      altogether out of place. It is a fitter denizen for realms beyond the
      tropic, where the broad-leaved banana hangs its clustering, golden flagons
      temptingly to the gaze, and where many-hued, various life rejoices in
      wanton prodigality.

      Though reared amid the rich savannas and fertile slopes of South Carolina,
      and the belt of country thence westward to the Pecos River, of Texas, it
      is only a temporary sojourner. With the first breath that comes from the
      north, in the fall, it takes its departure, and wings its flight to warmer
      latitudes. The land of the Aztec, and the warm isles of the sea to the
      southward, are its destination. A few individuals, fond of travel and
      change of scenery, do not, however, pause from their journey until they
      have reached the Isthmus which weds the two great halves of the American
      continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As spring approaches, an anxious spirit of restlessness seizes the males,
      which sooner or later communicates itself to the opposite sex. This is
      manifest some time before setting out. But guided by a never-erring
      instinct, they curb their impatience, and thus bring it under restraint.
      Hence, like many kindred species, they are not very early comers. The
      middle of April&mdash;the season of sunshine and of showers&mdash;usually
      dates their first appearance in the Gulf States, and from this time they
      are not slow in reaching their most northern homes. The lords, in their
      spruce and rich attires, generally lead their sober, unadorned companions
      by several days, and may be seen in low thickets along the borders of
      streams, among the rice plantations, or in the vicinity of the sad,
      cheerless sea. Fond of the lowlands, at such times, one would imagine that
      such situations would have a depressing effect, and render them gloomy and
      despondent. But this is far from being the truth. Almost from the
      beginning of their arrival, they are endowed with the propensity to sing,
      even before their partners have come. From the summit of a Wayside bush, a
      fence-rail, or from out the hedges of some suburban villa, their rich,
      mellifluent warblings may be heard to the infinite pleasure and joy of the
      weary pedestrian. These musical utterances resemble the notes of the
      common Indigo Bird, but lack their energy and power of sustentation. It is
      not now that their songs are heard to the best advantage, but when the
      season of mating occurs, a fortnight later. They are then in their
      happiest moods. The presence of the dear ones excites within them the
      passion of love, and calls forth the highest capabilities of their
      natures. In the days of Wilson these were recognized, and many a male-bird
      was captured and confined to a cage, by the French inhabitants of the
      lower parishes of Louisiana, not more for the splendor of his plumage, the
      docility of his manners, than for the sweetness of his song. Great numbers
      were not only decoyed into traps, and other devices, to satisfy the
      growing desire for such pets at home, but hundreds were shipped to other
      countries. But it is only of late years that their introduction into our
      northern cities has been an object of pecuniary profit, and now almost
      every fancier's store is made to rejoice with the dulcet strains of this
      beautiful and active little Finch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming back from this digression, let us view, for a few moments, the
      character of the sexes, and their behavior at the time of mating.
      Naturally pugnacious in the presence of a rival, the male is all
      gentleness and kindness when in the society of females, and exerts his
      best efforts to please and conciliate. The character of the female is the
      exact antithesis of his, and wins admiration by its sweetness and
      simplicity. Modest and plain in dress, she is equally artless and
      unassuming in demeanor. The courage which she sees displayed by her
      masculine protector does not impress her with feelings of awe and
      timidity, but challenges her admiration, confidence and esteem. Knowing
      that such conduct, so thoroughly devoid of civility as it seemeth, is but
      the outgrowth of jealous affection, she is drawn to him by an influence
      which she cannot control nor resist. Consequently, his road to happiness
      and bliss is one untrammeled by the cares and trials which beset the paths
      of less fortunate claimants for female favors. He has only to present his
      suit accompanied by the usual protestations of love, to have it honored
      with a prompt and willing acceptance. While these amours are being
      enacted, a rival dare not intrude upon the hallowed precincts. Such an act
      of temerity would but be the prelude to a bitter encounter, which must
      result in one or the other of the combatants being driven away discomfited
      and disgraced. The females are never known to take part in these affrays,
      but maintain, at a safe distance, an attitude of passivity. So well known
      to the bird-dealers of New Orleans is this peculiar disposition about
      which we have been writing, that advantage is taken thereof for the
      purposes of the trade. It is on this wise: A mounted male-bird is placed
      in a position of defence upon the platform of a trap-cage. As soon as
      discovered, it is attacked by a male-bird with determined vigor, and even
      after the trap is sprung, and the assailant has become an unwilling
      prisoner, these assaults are continued with zealous and unremitting
      pertinacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Events now follow each other in close succession. Pairing being
      solemnized, the birds seek themselves out a spot for a home. Low growths
      are usually selected. In Texas, thick mezquite-bushes and live oaks, and,
      in Louisiana, orange hedges, bramble and blackberry bushes, and,
      occasionally, the lower branches of trees are occupied. The height above
      the ground seldom exceeds ten feet, the usual elevation being from four to
      five feet. A crotch is generally the recipient of the fabric, except in
      cases where tangled bushes are used, when their booked and prong-like
      branches serve as girders of support.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the first of May, everything being in readiness, the ground-floor of
      the domicile is laid, and little by little the walls are raised, through
      the cool, united efforts of the two patient workers. By no means as
      artistic as some we have already described, yet it is, withal, a neat,
      comfortable and staid structure. The materials of composition are not at
      all varied, but usually consist of dried grass, vegetable stems, leaves in
      small quantities, fine rootlets, and silk of caterpillars, on the
      exterior, and horse-hairs, or the slender culms of grasses, on the
      interior. In many instances, the stems are clothed with long hairs, which
      serve as points of attachment to the cottony and silken fibres which bind
      the coarser substances together. A nest before us presents to the unaided
      vision a slight lustrous appearance from the vast numbers of membranous
      dessepiments or partitions&mdash;relics of seed-vessels that are adherent
      to most of the stems. The cavity has an even, unragged margin, which is
      due to the great pains taken in the disposition of the flaxen fibres
      which, in a great measure, compose it. On the whole, the outside is
      remarkably smooth and uniform, while the interior, with its
      circularly-arranged layers, is a perfect model of elegance and comfort.
      The height of the nest which we have figured, and the same may be
      reasonably true of all such structures, is two and one-tenth inches, and
      the width, two and nine-tenths. The opening is one and nine-tenths inches
      in diameter, and nearly the same in depth. This nest was collected in
      Comal County, Texas, on the ninth of May, 1881, and is a fair
      representation of the typical structure. In the drawing it is shown upon a
      live oak branch, of natural dimensions, and with the female in the
      distance. Her partner is figured in the foreground, and may be readily
      distinguished. His head and neck are a beautiful ultramarine-blue,
      excepting a narrow patch from the chin to the breast, which inclines to
      vermillion-red. The eye-lids, and the under parts generally, are of this
      latter shade, while the rump is tinged with purplish. All other parts (the
      lesser wing coverts, tail feathers, and outer webs of quills excluded) are
      green, excepting the interscapular region, which reflects a gloss of
      yellow, while the undescribed portions are purplish-blue. What a contrast
      to the female-bird, which can only boast of a dark green habit with a
      yellowish front. The young are the likeness of their mothers. The length
      of the adult is five and a half inches, and expanse of wings, two and
      seven-tenths.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first commencement of the home, to its final completion for
      occupancy, not more than a week elapses, and the female is ready to
      deposit her first instalment of eggs. This is succeeded by similar
      payments, to the number of four or five, of the great debt which Nature
      demands of her. Having settled the last obligation, she nestles down into
      her cosy chamber with the determination to watch and wait for the
      priceless treasures which she knows must be her ultimate reward. While she
      is thus about her agreeable business, her proud and dignified companion is
      abroad in quest of enjoyment and luxurious living. He seems to be the
      happiest of fellows. Could you hear him as he wends his way among the
      orangeries, in the full tide of song, you could not help feeling that he
      is the most thoughtless and cruel fellow of your acquaintance. Never a
      care does he appear to have for the patient little being who is sitting
      her life away, in order that his loneliness and hers shall be blessed with
      a happy house-full of children. But it is otherwise. Seemingly unmindful,
      he is at heart a clever being. Let but his home be invaded, and he is on
      the spot in an instant, ready to avenge any wrong, in his own summary
      manner, that may be attempted or committed. But his loving and Quaker-like
      housewife is possessed of greater forbearance. Trustful and gentle, she
      will often permit herself to be lifted from the nest rather than expose
      her jewels to the greed and cruelty of an unsympathizing world. While a
      comparatively close prisoner at home for a period of fourteen days during
      the incubating process, she, however, does occasionally quit its shadows,
      when sorely pressed by hunger, but only for a brief time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the young is the inauguration of a change in the male's
      demeanor. Proud of his progeny, he breaks away from his hitherto aimless
      habits, and makes amends therefore by becoming a very dutiful and
      affectionate parent. With equal zeal he assists his partner in collecting
      the various insects which contribute to their nourishment. As long as
      their helplessness continues, he may be thus observed. But when, after a
      period of thirteen or fourteen days, the young are able to quit the nest,
      he abates his care in a measure, and teaches them to help themselves. When
      sufficiently matured, like their parents, they feed upon rice, the seeds
      of figs, and the various grains peculiar to their native haunts, as well
      as upon insects. The young females soon acquire their proper dress, but
      the males, on the contrary, are slow in arriving at the same condition.
      Four years, at the farthest, are necessary to bring about the final
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are rounded-oval, of a white or grayish color, and beautifully
      marked with brown and violet-colored spots chiefly about the larger
      extremities, but more scattered, smaller and paler ones over the rest of
      the eggs. In some specimens from Texas and Louisiana, the violet spots
      predominate, thus contrasting in a marked manner with normal forms. The
      average dimensions of a set from Texas are as follows: .85 by .60, .80 by
      .60, .80 by .60 and .85 by .60 inches. Another set from Comal County, of
      the same State, measure respectively .81 by .03, .81 by .63, .75 by .63
      and .75 by .62 inches. Nests with eggs, found as late as June 21st, seem
      to warrant the belief that two broods are annually raised, but this needs
      confirmation. In confinement, as many as three are of common occurrence.

      willing support.

      Like love-sick swains of whom poets have delighted to sing, they seek such
      haunts, not more for their soothing, quieting influences, than for
      pleasures more substantial which they are sure to find. Here, unmolested
      by their great arch-enemy man, they can pursue their piscatorial
      occupation as suits them best. Who has not observed some lonely
      individual, with, apparently, every trace of care blotted out of his life,
      thus occupied from early morning until night-time? Those who love to quit
      the dust and turmoil of the city, to hold sweet communion with the visible
      forms of wood and dell, have been silent, speechless spectators of what we
      witness. However, for the benefit of such as have been denied this
      pleasure and privilege, we would invite them to a stroll into the country
      where babbling brook and quiet, sunny pond, adorn the prospect. The utmost
      silence must be maintained in these rambles, would you secure success. The
      presence of a human being upon the scene where these lordly princes of the
      piscine craft hold high revel, if detected, is almost sure to produce a
      stampede, and lead to a hasty departure. Hence, great care must be
      exercised in approaching their retreats, and even while quartered within
      the same. Once there, and snugly ensconced by environing bushes from view,
      you await developments. The object of your search may be but a few paces
      from you, and you not cognizant of it. Five minutes pass, and nothing is
      heard but the rumble of some distant cascade, the clatter of the stream as
      it laves its reedy banks and pebbled bed, or the rustle of the dry leaves
      around as they echo to the rabbit's heavy tread. Another space of equal
      length has followed after, and the moments seem lengthened into weary
      hours as you sit listening, and like results are your reward. But while
      being tossed to and fro upon the ragged edge of suspense, and almost
      bereft of hope, a loud, harsh rattle meets your ear. You look in the
      direction whence the sound came, and there, perched upon an overhanging
      bough just over your head, or a little to the right or left of you, stands&mdash;the
      very embodiment of majesty and power&mdash;the creature for whom you have
      been looking. Nor does he always occupy such a lofty position. Betimes, he
      seeks a lower level, and may be found upon a stranded, uplifted snag.
      Having discovered his whereabouts, you must watch him closely, for the cry
      which you have just heard, is the signal that precedes the assault that he
      is preparing to make upon some scaly denizen of the water that has had the
      folly to show its gilded, tempting form.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden, circular plunge, accompanied by a dull, heavy splash, and the
      frightened, squirming fish is wrested from its native element, and
      swallowed in an instant. In less time than it takes to chronicle the brief
      event, the daring, cruel deed is accomplished, and the perpetrator thereof
      has regained his post, and stands ready for similar adventures. Such is
      the greedy and unsatisfying character of his nature that, where
      undisturbed, he has been known to watch for hours at a time without
      changing his point of lookout. It must not be supposed, however, that the
      quantity of food which he devours is in proportion to the time spent in
      its procurement. This is not the case. Due allowance must be made for
      disappointments and reverses, as well as for the failure of the finny
      tribes to manifest themselves. Tired of watching, he often varies his
      occupation by coursing along the stream at a small height above its
      surface, and stopping anon, suspended after the fashion of Hawks, to gaze
      into the depths below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more interesting than the behavior of an individual who has
      miscalculated his chances, and fallen wide of his mark when plunging for
      prey. The very impersonation of disappointment, he retires to his post,
      sullen and dejected. His very attitude and looks attest the war of
      feelings waging within his bosom. But this is of short continuance. The
      thoughts of past experiences come to his rescue, and he is himself again.
      With the successful fellow the condition is different. Joy and happiness
      are depicted where, before, we saw but misery and sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      However intently these birds may seem to be occupied with the business
      before them, they are not so completely absorbed therein as to be utterly
      oblivious to their surroundings. Blessed with sharp vision, they are as
      equally favored in the direction of hearing. When the eye is engaged, like
      a faithful sentinel on duty the ear, whose function it is to receive and
      communicate vibrations of air to the brain where they are interpreted, is
      always on the alert, ready to warn its companion of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what has been written, it is evident that the desire for food seems
      uppermost in the thoughts of these birds from their first arrival&mdash;usually
      in March or April&mdash;until pairing commences. In its gratification, the
      female is the equal of her lord. Such being the case, it is unreasonable
      to expect any great degree, of familiarity and friendship to exist between
      the sexes. They, therefore, dwell apart. Accident sometimes brings them
      together, but beyond a silent recognition, they evince no greater regard.
      Thus affairs continue for a month, and even for a longer period of time,
      when they suddenly come to a most glorious end by the assumption of
      connubial relations. Nothing remarkable or impressive indicates the coming
      of this event. The male seems to meet his partner unawares, makes
      overtures of love in his own strange fashion, and becomes at once her
      uninfluenced choice. And thus the story is ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further ado, the wedded couple prepare for the duties of
      house-keeping. Usually they are spared the trouble of searching for a
      home. Especially is this the case with old birds, who have only to visit
      the scenes of other years to find a domicile awaiting occupancy. A little
      repairing of the galleries leading thereto, as well as the cosy, interior
      chamber, and the place soon wears an aspect of cheerfulness and comfort.
      But where these structures do not exist, they are excavated at great pains
      in the sides of ponds, streams, or cliffs contiguous to water. A very
      common place, in the latitude of Philadelphia, is in sandy, railroad
      cuttings. Dry, elevated grounds, beyond the reach of inundations, are
      ordinarily chosen, although there may be exceptions to the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      These burrows are the results of the alternate labors of the sexes, who
      work with diligence and rapidity until the task is accomplished, often
      making a deep excavation in a single night, when the bank is soft and
      sandy. The directions and depths of these holes vary: some being less than
      four feet, while others are more than fifteen feet deep; some being
      straight, and others turning either to the right or to the left before
      terminating in the enlarged chamber which is constructed as a place of
      deposit for the eggs. The time spent in the formation of a burrow depends
      upon the nature of the soil and the length of the shaft. Ordinarily two
      days are required for its completion, although instances are recalled
      where three, and even four days, have been occupied with the tunneling.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the successful accomplishment of this task, nothing further remains
      to be done but to deposit the eggs upon the bare sand. Some birds do not
      deem their labor finished until they have given their home a warm lining
      of dried grasses and feathers. Such cases are exceptional, and dependent
      upon the humidity of the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1855, Dr. Brewer discovered a nest of this species on Mt. Washington,
      alongside of a carriage-drive, and at a distance of a mile from any
      water-shallows. Another was found in a sand-bank in the village of
      Hingham, in close proximity to a dwelling, and quite remote from stream or
      pond. The authors of the latter nest were very cautious and retiring,
      seldom venturing out during the day, but were continually moving backward
      and forward at night, as evidenced by their loud, rattling cries. When
      with young these nocturnal excursions are not infrequent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of the building habits of these birds, reminds us of a curious
      fact which occurred in the history of a male-bird, of which Mr. Dali, of
      Washington, was an eye-witness. On a certain occasion his attention was
      attracted to his lordship engaged in digging holes by the side of his
      nest, which were two feet in depth and eight inches in diameter,
      apparently for no other purpose than that of pleasure or occupation. They
      were invariably abandoned as soon as constructed. Once, he entered one of
      these burrows to eat a fish which he had captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many fabulous stories have been told in ages that are past of the nest and
      manner of hatching of the Kingfishers, but they are too absurd and
      trifling to deserve more than a passing notice. The birds of our day
      neither construct their nests of glue or fishbones, nor commit them to the
      mercy of the waters to float about at random with their proprietors, but
      place them deep down in the earth, where they are secure from wind and
      rain, and the thousand perils which threaten the homes of their less
      sagacious neighbors. Into these secret recesses the females place their
      pure white, nearly spherical treasures, to the number of six, on as many
      consecutive clays. These beautiful solids exhibit not more than ordinary
      variation in size, and rarely exceed 1.31 of an inch in length, and 1.06
      in breadth from the most diverse localities.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the beginning of June, sometimes two months earlier in the
      semi-tropical sections of our country, the young, through the patient
      setting of the mother-bird, make their appearance. While she is thus
      concerned for fourteen long, weary days, her partner plays the role of a
      very faithful and attentive husband, amply providing for her sustenance.
      Both parents show great affection for their little family, and watch over
      it with jealous and assiduous care. Weak and fragile creatures as they are
      at birth, they cannot digest the unprepared food of adults, but must needs
      have it reduced to a pulpy state by a process of maceration. Later on this
      is discontinued, and the birdlings perform the important duty for
      themselves. At the age of fifteen days they are old enough to quit the
      nest, but usually remain a brief period longer, when they venture out and
      try the fortunes of the outside world. At nights they return to the hole
      where they were fledged, and also during rainy weather, until the last of
      October, or the middle of November, when they leave their parents, and
      like the latter, separate and wend their flight to the South, or to
      regions beyond. When the season is unusually propitious, they seek more
      sheltered localities, and spend the winter with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the male the female, as shown in the drawing, is readily
      distinguished, by having the sides of the body and a transverse band
      across the abdominal region, and slightly posterior to the bluish one of
      the breast, light-chestnut, the pectoral band' being more or less tinged
      with the same color. The young resemble the mother in the fall, but when
      spring re-appears, the males present themselves in the paternal garb. The
      length of the adult is about twelve and three-quarters inches; that of the
      wing, six, and sometimes more. The small opening in the embankment shows
      the entrance to a nest, and a female making her way thither.

      misapprehension exists in relation to the popular appellation applied to
      this species. In some parts of the country it is dubbed the Partridge,
      while in others it goes by the name of Pheasant. It is neither. All its
      affinities point away from these families, in the direction of the True
      Grouse, of which it constitutes a useful and interesting member. Pheasants
      are never found in the United States, but are indigenous to Southern Asia.
      Their nearest representative here is the Wild Turkey. Almost as much may
      be said of the Partridge, a group of birds 'which are exclusive denizens
      of the Old World. To save further confusion, we have thought it best to
      perpetuate in this work the title given above. While it can offer no
      violence to scientific accuracy, it cannot be otherwise than acceptable to
      the common sense of the masses, although it be less euphonious than its
      contemporaries. The wear and tear of constant use will soften its
      asperities and harshness, and render it, in the long run, agreeable as it
      is appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This matter settled, we shall proceed at once to the subject. Few Grouse
      are better known, and none more esteemed for its flesh, than the one we
      have chosen for a few remarks. Everywhere throughout the timbered regions
      of Eastern North America it is more or less plentiful, ranging from the
      Atlantic seaboard to the Rocky Mountains, and from Georgia to Nova Scotia.
      As far north as the 56th parallel it is said by Richardson to abound in
      small flocks which show considerable lack of suspicion and timidity. In
      all our Southern States, Louisiana excepted, they exist to some extent,
      and are also to be found over limited portions of the Missouri Region,
      but, doubtless, more especially about the mouth of the river, and the
      contiguous country. In the western parts of the region it is represented
      by a form which passes with ornithologists as a well-defined, genuine
      variety. In California, it is presumed to be wanting, as Dr. Newberry did
      not encounter any specimens in his explorations; but in the wooded
      sections of the Cascade Range, where it exists under a new varietal name,
      and also in the valley of the Willamet in Oregon, it is by no means an
      uncommon occupant. It is in the New England, Middle Atlantic and Northern
      Central States that these birds are to be seen to best advantage, and in
      greatest numbers. West of the Mississippi, if we exclude Eastern Kansas,
      Southern Iowa and the whole of Missouri, they occur, if at all, in
      comparatively small and isolated parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regions which these Grouse inhabit, they are permanent residents, and
      are never known to move southward with the retreat of warm weather. They
      are capable of adapting themselves to climatic variations with ease, but
      not so readily to surface irregularities and their natural concomitants.
      Dense woods, craggy mountain-sides, and the borders of streams, are noted
      places of resort. Lowlands, especially such as are invested with thick
      growths of small bushes and tall rank grasses, are not infrequently
      chosen. When in quest of food and gravel, they are known to quit their
      favorite haunts, and betake themselves to the open road, where groups may
      be seen absorbed in feeding. Not to that extent, however, when the rustle
      of a moving leaf, or the crackling of a twig, would pass unnoticed. The
      slightest noise causes a temporary suspension of labor, and a shudder of
      surprise. All of a sudden, and in the most perfect harmony, all heads are
      raised and pointing in the direction whence the noise proceeded. The keen
      visions of these birds are not slow in discerning through the gloomy
      recesses the presence of danger. Should nothing of an alarming character
      manifest itself, a short parley ensues, and business is resumed, but not
      with the same earnestness and apparent lack of care as before. Greater
      caution is observable, and every effort taken to prevent an ambuscade. But
      let the cause of the alarm, in the shape of clog or man, be close at hand,
      and the birds immediately strike for the cover, either on foot, or by
      means of flight. The latter method is only adopted in extreme cases, when
      the other course would be attended by disaster and probable ruin. In the
      exercise of their cursorial powers, they move with remarkable swiftness,
      as with head depressed, and tail expanded, they run for their lives. A
      pile of brushwood, or an impenetrable jungle, when near, is rendered
      subservient. There they manage to conceal themselves for a time, and thus
      recover breath. If closely pursued, and in danger of being trampled upon
      by the foot of the huntsman, or lacerated by the fangs of his quadrupedal
      friend, they await the opportune moment when, with sudden, whirring wings,
      they cleave the elastic ether, and vigorously press forward to some
      transitory haven of security, but to fall once more in the way of their
      relentless persecutors. These flights are so well-timed and unexpected
      that many an experienced gunner is thrown off his guard, and when, at
      last, he has recovered from his surprise and collected his thoughts, feels
      vexed at himself for allowing his equanimity to become unsettled by so
      familiar a strategem. He finds it useless to repine, but endeavors to
      choke down the bitter sigh of disappointment that arises, as he presses
      forward to further adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the common domestic Hen, these Grouse are strictly gregarious,
      especially during the autumnal and winter months. The flocks which they
      form vary in numbers, and when disturbed while feeding, scatter in all
      directions, each member seeking only its own individual safety and
      wellbeing. But after the lapse of a few minutes, they become reassured,
      and begin to gather simultaneously about the same spot, traveling the
      entire distance on foot. The utmost circumspection and vigilance are
      always exercised in these backward movements. Scarcity of food
      occasionally causes these birds, where very numerous in mountainous
      districts, to migrate to other places. These journeys are usually effected
      about the middle of October, they then being in excellent order and in
      great demand for the table. Audubon witnessed, in the fall of 1820, an
      immense number <i>in transitu</i> from Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, to
      Kentucky. Many of these became the prey of man, while their companions who
      had escaped destruction sought, with the return of Spring, their own
      cherished haunts. This disposition to lead a roving, migratory life, as a
      general thing, is not hereditary, and is seldom undertaken. Plenty of food
      is usually to be found in localities which these birds frequent, and the
      necessity does not exist. Where there is a paucity of appropriate
      food-stuffs, such as acorns, the seeds of the beech and of the various
      species of birch, they do not hesitate to devour the buds of the Mountain
      Laurel, which imparts a poisonous character to their flesh. When severely
      pressed by hunger, they feed upon dry bark, the insects that harbor in the
      creviced trunks and branches of trees, and even stray to the roads that
      wander through their gloomy retreats, and pick at the hard, frozen
      horse-droppings which they chance to encounter. But when Spring returns,
      and renews her bond of faith with mother Earth, they more than make up for
      their scanty winter fare, and feast with fastidious appetites upon the now
      tender and juicy buds of the black birch, which gives a peculiar and
      toothsome flavor to their flesh, that has acquired for them, in some
      localities, the name of Birch Partridge. For a brief spell every other
      interest is now absorbed in that of unrestrained feasting to which the
      sexes submit themselves with all the abandon of civilized humanity. The
      middle of March, or the close of the month devoted by the ancient Romans
      to purifications and fastings that precedes, when the weather is
      favorable, marks a change in their life. This era is announced by a loud
      druming noise which is everywhere to be heard. Standing upon a tall rock,
      or a fallen log, in some secluded woods or other locality, the author of
      this noise may be found. His altitude and demeanor must be observed to be
      appreciated. Once seen, he can never be forgotten. Arrayed in his new
      spring-suit, he is a being not to be despised. But this is not all. His
      beautifully-contracted neck, broad, expanded, fan-like tail, and elevated
      feather-tufts that ornament both sides of his neck, as he struts about
      with all the grace 'and dignity of some pompous lord or duke, render him
      of no mean importance, and add greatly to his attractiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is its final actions that impress the beholder with wonder and
      admiration. The hitherto trailing wings now assume a condition of
      rigidity, and commence a firm, but slow, downward and forward movement,
      which steadily increases in power and rapidity, until the
      swiftly-vibrating wings appear only as a semi-circular outline of mist
      above the bird, thus giving rise to a sound which may be appropriately
      likened to the reverberations of distant, muttering thunder. These sounds
      are most generally heard during the cool hours of the morning, when the
      spirits are buoyant after a night of refreshing slumber. But as the day
      advances, they are less frequent, and irregular. So nicely can they be
      imitated, that many a bird is drawn to his doom, when advancing to meet a
      supposed antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the drumming of the Ruffed Grouse is as often heard in fall as in
      spring, it has long been a mooted question as to its significancy as the
      call-note of the male during the breeding-period. But there cannot be the
      least doubt of the correctness of this interpretation, for we have the
      most incontestable proof of it in the responsive actions of the female.
      Nuttall is probably correct in ascribing the autumnal exhibition of the
      same wonderful power to self-gratification, and in affirming it to be, in
      many instances, "an instinctive expression of hilarity and vigor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the peculiar drumming sound which the males produce during the
      love-season, they give expression to vocal utterances which are no less
      remarkable. These are generally given forth when about to arise from the
      ground, and consist of two well-defined and characteristic notes. The
      first may be described as a sort of cackle, repeated several times in
      lively succession. The other, which closely follows in its wake, is a
      peculiar lisping whistle, which has not inaptly been compared to the cry
      of a young bird. These notes doubtless play a part in the reconcilement
      and bringing together of the sexes after their temporary separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the courting-season continues, it is not an uncommon occurrence to
      find a single male in the midst of several females, before whom he is
      engaged in showing off his many good qualities and graces. In such a
      dilemma, it is no easy matter to make a selection. Enamored by so many, he
      is sometimes disposed to be gay and trifling, and to dally with the
      affections of some pure and simple-minded female. Thus we often find him
      carrying on the most cruel flirtations. But when he does bring himself
      earnestly down to the business of choosing a partner, he does not go about
      it in an uncertain, hesitating manner, but makes his selection with
      promptness and dispatch. The successful female, proud of the honor
      conferred, at the call of her lord, forsakes the group of unmarried
      sisters, and follows him wherever he listeth. The warmest tokens of
      affection and regard are lavished upon her, and woe to the rival who
      should appear upon the scene while these amours are being enacted. Should
      such an event come to pass, the intruder is at once assailed, and a long
      and bloody encounter ensues, which results in the death of one or other of
      the combatants, but never in the complete vanquishment of the defensive
      party. Instances are known where males have treated their first choice
      with cruel indifference, and ultimately deserted them. Such things could
      not otherwise be when the question of polygamy comes to be considered, for
      it is a fact that both birds are slightly promiscuous in their
      intercourse, although the tendency is more marked upon the part of the
      male.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of mating varies somewhat with climate, and with the conditions
      of the season. In the warm sections of the South it occurs late in March,
      or early in April. But further north where winter still lingers with
      frosty coldness, the latter month is well nigh verging to its close, or
      gliding into the succeeding period, before this essential business is
      thought of. But when it does happen, with but little waste of time, the
      female withdraws herself from the society of her partner, and repairs to a
      secluded spot in the midst of a woods, where usually beneath a clump of
      evergreen, or a pile of brush, or perhaps a fallen log or projecting rock,
      she hastily scratches a few dry leaves together for a nest. Here she
      deposits, one by one, in as many consecutive days, her complement of six
      to twelve eggs, and immediately enters upon the duties of incubation. In
      this she is alone, the male lending no assistance, not even indirectly by
      attending to her demands for food. While she is thus occupied, he seeks
      the company of others of his sex, with whom he remains until the young are
      nearly full-grown, when he joins the family, and dwells with it until
      spring. The period of incubation ranges from nineteen to twenty days.
    </p>
    <p>
      When first hatched, the young follow their mother, and soon learn to
      comprehend her clucking call, as well as act responsively thereto. Few
      mothers are more devoted to their children, and it is a rare occasion to
      find one who is more courageous and wily in their defence. Let her family
      be surprised by friend or foe, a single note of alarm is all that is
      necessary to cause the brood to scatter, and with the most clever
      adroitness to hide themselves beneath a bunch of leaves or grass. So
      successfully is the concealment accomplished, that a careful and
      protracted search is often necessary to discover their whereabouts. Often
      when squatting by the roadside with her brood, the parent is taken
      unawares. This is the trial which she of all others seems to dread. To
      save her little ones she perils her own life by venturing upon an assault.
      Her first impulse is to fly at the face of the intruding party, but sober
      thought comes to her rescue, and teaches her the folly of such a course.
      She yields, and the very next moment we find her tumbling over and over
      upon the ground, apparently in the deepest distress, but soon to recover
      her self-possession in time to carry out the final piece upon the
      programme&mdash;a <i>ruse</i> in which lameness is imitated with wonderful
      ingenuity. While the mother is thus agitated, the birdlings are seen to
      scamper in every direction to places of shelter. Having accomplished her
      allotted part, the happy mother now flies away, and by her well-known
      cluck soon gathers her brood together. The cry of the young is a simple <i>peet</i>,
      which is heard repeatedly during feeding, but only occasionally while
      nestling. Their food consists of the seeds of various plants, and berries.
      While able to search for their own food, they derive considerable
      assistance from the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such cunning, wee creatures, when first they leave the egg, can only be
      compared with the young of our barnyard fowls. Dressed in a simple garb,
      they look but little like their parents. Above they show a uniform
      reddish-brown or rufous color, which fades into a rusty-white hue below.
      With the exception of a dusky streak which starts from the posterior part
      of the eye and crosses the auricular regions obliquely downward, and a
      whitish bill, they have nothing to diversify the monotony of their
      coloring. But when they have attained the age of four or five months, they
      show their heredity so plainly that their identity cannot be disputed or
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the adult stage the tail is reddish-brown or gray above, with narrow
      bars of black. Terminally, it is crossed by a slender band of pale ash,
      which is preceded by a broader one of black, and this by another of an
      ashy color. The upper parts are ochraceous-brown, and finely mottled with
      grayish markings. The lower parts are chiefly white, with broad transverse
      bars of light brown, which are mostly hidden from view upon the abdomen.
      Upon the shoulders the shafts of the feathers have pale streaks, which
      exist in those of the wing-coverts. The upper tail-coverts and the wings
      are marked with pale grayish cordate spots, while the lower tail-coverts
      are pale ochraceous, each being provided with a terminal deltashaped spot
      of white, which is bordered with dusky. The neck-tufts are brownish-black.
      The male measures eighteen inches in length, and has a breadth of wings of
      seven and two-tenths inches. The tail is about seven inches long. The
      female is smaller than the latter, with similar colors, but has less
      prominent tufts upon the sides of the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species are usually of a uniform dark cream color, but
      sometimes show a nearly pure-white ground. In most specimens there are no
      markings at all, but when they do occur, are either quite numerous and
      conspicuous, or few in number, and obscure. They are usually ovoidal, but
      forms are occasionally met with which are nearly spherical. Their average
      dimensions, as obtained from specimens from the most diverse localities,
      are about 1.64 to 1.18 inches. As far as we have been able to determine
      the species has never been known to produce more than a single brood.
      Usually nesting is performed on the ground, as shown in the cut, but
      instances are recorded by Samuels where the female has occupied a deserted
      Crow's nest, or the shelter of some tall broken trunk of a tree.

      Plate XXX.&mdash;STERNA ANTILLARUM, (Less.) Coues.&mdash;Least Tern.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or diminutiveness
      of size, nimbleness and grace of action, this species stands alone among
      its kin, and has been very properly likened in its movements to the
      sprightly, elfish Humming-bird. This comparison holds true in this latter
      particular, as those who have had the privilege of watching these Terns in
      their pleasurable aerial diversions can testify, but there is lacking that
      essentiality which makes the other seem, when fluttering before a tulip, a
      mere materialized sylph from the land of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can give the enthusiastic lover of Nature more true and unalloyed
      happiness than the study of our aquatic friend in his own loved haunts,
      and while in the delightful exercise of his volant powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His majestic sailing through the pellucid atmosphere, whether for pleasure
      or game, the beautiful equipoise of body as on motionless wings he hangs
      suspended above the liquid abyss below, the sudden, impetuous, hawk-like
      plunge when some luckless sprat rises to view, and last, but not least,
      the easy manner with which he arrests his downward course and bounds
      aloft, must be seen to form an adequate conception of the wonderful powers
      of flight with which the <i>least</i> of all our Terns is endowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although fond of the deep-blue sea, with its sad and
      never-ending-monotone, and the dreary, almost barren waste of sands that
      line its tortuous, plantless shores, it is by no means an exclusive
      dweller by such haunts. Inspired by a love of adventure, and burning for
      new sights and forms of life, it quits the shadow of Neptune's trident,
      and wends its way up the various water-courses that tend seaward, to
      quieter inland scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      While more especially abundant in maritime regions, it is, however, more
      general in tracts remote therefrom than has been commonly supposed. So
      that instead of the whole vast army betaking themselves to the thousand
      miles stretching along the Atlantic, many from the Gulf in the South, may
      be seen, when the tide of migration has set in, wending their ways in
      small parties along the vast central artery of our land to the distant
      valley of the Missouri, and elsewhere. Towards the setting sun, another
      current takes its northward course, but spends its strength on the mild,
      equable shores of California before any considerable elevation is
      attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whence come these birds? This is a question that is often asked, but most
      difficult of solution. That they winter beyond the borders of the United
      States there can be no doubt. After quitting our shores, it is highly
      probable they seek the tropical realms of Central America, or the breezy
      isles of the Larger Antilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But wherever they go, there they remain until the snows of their northern
      homes have disappeared. So delicate and susceptible to cold are they that
      even along our Southern sea-bordering States, where the felicitous change
      first manifests itself, they delay their visit until the early days of
      April are come. But it is not until this delightful month of the year has
      stepped aside to welcome her smiling sister, that the cooler shores of New
      Jersey are reached. From this latitude they pursue their journey to the
      extreme limits of their habitat.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little they settle down to the very important business which has
      inspired the journey. The twenty-fifth of May, or the beginning of the
      month sacred to Juno, marks the love-season, which is of short
      continuance. Having accomplished their loves and selected partners, the
      sexes now turn their attention to household matters. The first thing to be
      done is the selection of a spot and the preparation of a home. This part
      of the business pertains exclusively to the female, and, seemingly, is
      accounted of trifling moment. Like most of her terrestrial, and many of
      her aquatic neighbors, she does not build a house, but on the pebbly
      shingle just back of the beach, places her eggs on the bare ground, with
      not so much as a bit of sea-weed or of grass beneath them. The merest
      apology of a nest is often denied them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of eggs deposited varies from one to two, the latter being the
      ordinary number. Instances are recorded where as many as three have been
      found as a nest-complement, but there certainly must be some mistake,
      which could easily happen in localities where many birds are breeding
      together. Where more than one is laid, a day usually intervenes between
      the two deposits. Nothing is more difficult to find, even when plentiful,
      than the eggs of this species, owing to the similarity of their color to
      the surroundings. Their ground sometimes presents a greenish-white color,
      but tends more to olivaceous or dull drab. The markings are numerous,
      pretty generally diffused, but when of large size, are mostly wreathed
      about the larger extremity. They consist of irregular blotches and dots of
      different shades of brown, interspersed with numerous obscure spots of
      lilac. Their average measurements are 1.26 by 1.02 inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having committed her treasures to mother-earth, the female has little else
      to do than to guard them from harm. The heat of the sand, when the skies
      are undimmed by cloud or mist, is sufficient for hatching purposes. The
      application of living heat, so to speak, is unnecessary, and it is even a
      question in our minds whether the female could endure the inconvenience
      and trials of the incubating process, in the midst of a broiling sun upon
      a sandy sea-shore. But during wet and stormy weather, and at night, this
      duty is actually incumbent upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the young, after a period of sixteen or seventeen days,
      brings the parents nearer together, and keeps them more at home. While
      kind and affectionate to each other, it is the attention which they bestow
      upon their happy little family that commands our admiration, and gives
      special prominence to their character. With true parental instinct they
      watch over their early helplessness, and provide them with an abundance of
      wholesome diet. Beetles, spiders, crickets and other insects, as well as
      prawns, shrimps, skippers and small fish, form their dietary. But it is
      not only by feeding them that they conserve to their well-being, but also
      by protecting them when assailed by enemies. The sight of an intruder is
      greeted with shrill cries of remonstrance from a whole chorus of voices.
      This not having the desired effect, a score of angry birds of both sexes
      dash boldly upon him, as though to punish him for such rashness.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the middle of June the earliest broods are on the wing. This, however,
      is rather premature, for the greater part are not in a condition for
      flight until the fore part of the month after. Associated with them may
      often be seen plenty of immature birds of last summer's hatchings, as well
      as the adults themselves. The yearlings are easily distinguished by the
      black bill, slightly forked tail, slate-colored occiput and auriculars,
      imperfect coloration of the primaries, absence of black cap or white
      crescent, and the presence of a dark band along the edge of the wing. With
      birds of the season, which show a strangely-variegated dress of
      grayish-brown and white, there is no possibility of being mistaken or
      confounded. The assumption of the perfect plumage usually requires a
      period of two years. Both sexes are similarly clad. During the
      breeding-season they have the entire upper parts and wings of a clear
      bluish-gray, variegated with a triangular white spot on the forehead
      reaching to the eye, and deep black crown and occiput, as well as a line
      from the eye to the upper mandible of the same color. The first ten
      primary wing feathers have the shafts black, the outer webs and half the
      inner next the shaft, grayish-black, ends concolorous, and inner margins
      white. The remaining primaries are of the same color as the back, with
      inner margins white. Excepting the outer borders of the external feathers,
      and the inner webs of the others basally, which are white, the tail is
      slaty. The whole under parts are of a lustrous white color, while the bill
      is a pale orange-yellow, iris hazel, and legs and feet a light orange-red.
      The length of these birds is about nine inches; their wings six and
      three-quarters, and the tail a trifle more than one-half of the latter
      measurement. Young birds are correspondingly smaller.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>nhabiting the vast
      continents lying to the eastward of our own, exists a family of birds
      popularly known as Stone-chats. Though mainly denizens of the Old World,
      yet they are not without their representatives in the New. To this group
      belongs the genus Sialia, notwithstanding the possession of structural
      peculiarities which ally it to the Thrushes. Of aves claiming such
      affinity, none is better known than the above species.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the eastern faunal area of North America, from Georgia and
      Louisiana to the 48th parallel of north latitude, and westward to the
      highlands of the Mississippi, our genial, sky-blue friend abounds, in
      varying numbers, and rears its triple brood. Along the Atlantic seaboard,
      it never ventures as far north as it does in the interior, being rarely
      observed beyond the Penobscot River, although Verrill met with it in
      abundance in Western Maine. Six hundred miles out at sea, in the
      delightful climate of the Bermudas, it finds a permanent residence, and is
      also to be seen in Spanish Cuba, but only on rare occasions. Among the
      lofty ridges and open table-lands of the Rockies, it never occurs, but
      gives place to an apparently hardier species, the Arctic Bluebird of
      naturalists; while west of this vast mountain barrier, another form
      prevails.
    </p>
    <p>
      So strongly attached to the natal spot do these birds become, that it is
      with profound feelings of regret that they leave it. It is only when the
      rigors and snows of our northern winters have denied them a living, and
      thus rendered a longer sojourn impossible, that they take their departure
      for the South. Here they while away the dreary hours as best they can,
      until the returning footsteps of Sol have announced the glad tidings that
      the hallowed, time-honored haunts of the north will soon once more appear
      in beautiful habiliments of green. Excepting such as spend their entire
      lives in semi-tropical abodes, there is manifest an intense longing to be
      gone, which must necessarily detract from the happiness of their migratory
      brethren. This emotion often grows to such strength, that even in the
      mild, sunny weather of February, with which earth sometimes indulges her
      children, the brown, scored and pitted face of Nature is often rejoiced
      with their delightful presence. Amid the desolation which everywhere
      abounds, they dart upon the vision like the first gleam of sunshine after
      a day of dark and rainy weather. The bright, ruddy glow that burns upon
      the breast, as if in cruel mockery of earth's coldness, and the rich depth
      of coloring of the back, before whose vivid azure the very heavens seem to
      pale, are in striking contrast to objects around, and thrill the soul of
      man with gladness as the wearers of these charming hues are the bearers of
      glad intelligence, for they come to remind us that laughing field and
      babbling runnel have not entirely deserted us, but will return to enliven
      the prospect when a few more days have rung their changes on the endless
      cycle of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while a few home-sick individuals thus come among us, ere the backbone
      of winter has been broken, to renew old friendships, and point to bonnier
      times, it is not until the first sunny days of March have made their
      appearance, that the tide of emigration is said to set in with
      earnestness. Coming from no great distance, they are not long on the
      journey, and in a few days are pretty well established in the old
      habitats. At first they are seen in open fields, or loitering about the
      outskirts of woods. In rural situations they are not slow in working their
      way into old orchards, and the yards adjoining human habitations. But
      wherever they take up their quarters, they are sure to make themselves
      friends. Few species are more encouraged to build about our domains, and
      none are in greater repute. While the Robin and Orioles do immense service
      in the destruction of thousands of obnoxious insects, they frequently
      offset this good character by the mischief which they commit upon our
      fruit-trees while in blossom. Not so with the Bluebird. He disdains such
      meanness, and labors solely for man's interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in our midst, he does not foolishly waste his time in riotous
      living, and worse than bacchanalian riot, but goes directly to the work
      which has called him North. Consequently, from many a field and
      forest-border may be heard the soft, plaintive notes of the male. These
      notes are singularly pleasing and touching, and are well calculated to
      arouse a feeling of sympathy in the bosom of the most inhuman of men. At
      this period, which marks the incipient stages of courting, he is heard to
      the best advantage, although occasionally through the summer, and in the
      fall when preparing to leave us, he is known to descant somewhat similar
      strains, but with less of pathos and effort. The following syllabic
      language is as accurate a representation of the song as it is possible to
      express it by human vocal characters: <i>tür-r-r-r-wâ,
      tïir-wüh-tür-r-r-wû, tür-r-r-h' wêêt</i>. While engaged in its rendition
      from the topmost bough of a cedar, or the uppermost rail of a fence, his
      attitude shows such complete absorption in the subject, and such
      obliviousness to place and surroundings, as to awaken the profoundest
      wonder. The approach of footsteps is unheeded, and many a time we have
      made our way to within a few paces of one of these famous minstrels,
      without producing momentary surprise, or the least disarrangement of the
      harmony. All the while the concert is going on, the female is in the
      immediate vicinity, silent and motionless, and apparently drinking in its
      full import. But after a little the music ceases. The performer now leaves
      his post, flies towards the listening and solitary auditor, hangs on
      quivering wings suspended before her, and thus having made obsequious
      obeisance, alights a short distance away to ascertain the effects of all
      these efforts to please. Again and again, at regular intervals, the
      performance is repeated, and at last the female succumbs to the magnetic
      influence, and becomes a bride. All this is accomplished in less than a
      week from the time of arrival, long before most other small birds have
      thought of conjugal responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the tenth of March the happy couple are ready to go house-hunting. The
      female assumes the direction, and it is not long before they are suited.
      Their usual nesting-place is some cranny in a dead tree, or the vacant
      hole of a departed Woodpecker. The snapping off of a time-honored limb has
      often opened the way for a snug retreat. Almost any nook or cavity will
      answer in a pinch. Birds have been known to build in a deep fissure
      between the branches of a tree, in a broken tin water-spout under the
      eaves of a building, between the blind and sash of an almost forsaken
      window, in the stolen home of some eave swallow, in boxes and gourds, or
      occasionally in the forked branch of an apple-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a garden or orchard is chosen, objections are sometimes made by other
      species, and frequent encounters are recorded between the Bluebirds and
      such Wrens, Martins and Sparrows as deem themselves to have been badly
      treated by the former. In these affrays, contrary to expectation, the
      Bluebird is usually victorious, being more than a match for the smallest
      of our Woodpeckers, and even lording it over such professional fighters as
      the English Sparrow. But his pluckiest and most inveterate enemy is the
      House Wren. This tiny buccaneer will often visit the Bluebird's snug
      house, while the mistress is absent, and after raking out the materials,
      remain in possession. Any attempt, however, at interference when the
      family is within, is treated as an insult, and summarily avenged Generally
      Madam Bluebird and her husband are such gentle, quiet bodies that they
      never think of molesting their neighbors. As in well-regulated human
      communities, there are individuals who are not above such meanness. A case
      in point came under our observation some five or six years ago. A pair of
      Great-crested Flycatchers, finding an empty tomato-can secured to the top
      of a post, had made it their home and treasure-house. Shortly afterwards a
      pair of Bluebirds came upon the scene, and coveting the cosy quarters,
      sought to expel the rightful owners. The Flycatchers resisted, and the
      property-owner, desirous of ending the disturbance, shot the female
      Bluebird. The male immediately flew away, but to return in the course of a
      half-hour with two females. The contest was renewed, and victory decided
      in his favor. The Flycatchers, however, did not retire until they had
      thrown out the nesting-materials, a portion of which they afterwards
      carried away to use elsewhere. After the defeat the Bluebird selected a
      partner from his allies, and the unfortunate female gracefully retired.
      The proprietor, perceiving a strong predilection upon the part of the
      Bluebirds for the can, determined to annoy them awhile, and fastened a
      lath across the entrance, and watched the result. The birds set to work,
      and the piece was dislodged. They built their nest, deposited their eggs,
      and raised their broods, which they fed upon two species of turnip
      butterfly, and the wingless bodies of Spilosoma, a moth destructive to the
      grape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into their domicile the birds convey a good deal of grass, which they
      cover with a soft layer of hair, feathers and wool. While the male assists
      at this labor, the arrangement of details involved in the preparation of
      the furniture, falls to the lot of his partner. While she is thus busy, he
      relieves the tedium of the task by a song, and a few caresses. In the
      Northern States the nest is finished and the first eggs deposited by the
      10th of April; in the South much earlier. Why the Bluebird selects
      cavities as nesting places, does not readily appear. Being an early
      breeder, such situations best secure warmth and shelter for the young. In
      primitive times hollow trees were doubtless occupied more generally than
      at present by all birds, just as now they are constantly used as hospitia
      by our winter residents during disagreeable weather. The Bluebird learned
      to build in cavities by first using such places for shelter during cold,
      vernal storms, and perceiving their comfort, has come to regard them as
      appropriate quarters for nesting. Thus what was merely accidental to their
      ancestors, has now become intuitive and habitual to the race. Protection
      against rapacious birds is also secured, which would not be gained if the
      bright plumage of the female were exposed in an open nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As no dampness is to be dried, laying follows closely upon the completion
      of the nest, and continues for a period of five clays, one egg being laid
      daily. They are usually of a sky-blue color, spotless, and have an actual
      measurement of .82 by .61 inches. Mr. Ingersoll once found in Loraine
      County, Ohio, a nest of five eggs, all of which were pure lustrous white,
      like those of a Woodpecker. Similar instances have come to our knowledge
      since the above was recorded. In the work of incubation, the male
      occasionally relieves his partner, but when not thus engaged, lie is very
      attentive, and often cheers the monotony of her task by a soft, agreeable
      warble. He is also now very jealous. Not a bird is permitted to trespass
      upon his premises. If surprised upon the nest, the female makes no effort
      to escape as long as untouched; but waits until you have withdrawn to a
      safe distance before flying from the hole. When hatched, the young are
      watched over with the greatest care, and fed alternately by each parent.
      Their food consists of flies, earthworms, young of beetles, moths,
      butterflies, etc. When able to shift for themselves, they are entrusted to
      the care of the male, while the female busies herself in preparing for the
      second brood. The old nest is renovated and refurnished, and she again
      sits, depending upon her affectionate and trustful mate for the support of
      both herself and the brood which, as it sometimes happens, are not fairly
      out of the way when the second family of young are ushered into existence.
      As many as three broods are occasionally raised, when the season has been
      long and favorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young males of the year are easily distinguished. They are dull brown on
      the head and back, and have the lesser coverts streaked with white. The
      throat and fore part of the breast are marked with similar stripes, while
      the rest of the coloration, with the exception of the brownish edges of
      the tertial wing-feathers, is somewhat similar to that of the adult. The
      entire upper parts, including tail and wings, of the latter, are of a
      continuous and azure-blue color. The cheeks are of the same hue, but
      duller. The under parts, the abdomen, anal region (and under tail-coverts,
      which are white, excluded), are reddish-brown. The bill and feet are
      black, and the same may be said of the shafts of the quills and
      tail-feathers. From her partner, the female differs in being less blue,
      and in having a brownish cast upon the head and back. In size, they hardly
      vary. Their length is six and three-fourths inches, wing four, tail two
      and nine-tenths.

      Redstart
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the habit of
      capturing insects upon the wing, the sylvicoline subfamily of birds to
      which the Redstart belongs, resembles very closely the smaller
      Flycatchers, but it differs in being less sedentary. When in pursuit of
      food, it is constantly on the move, in and out among the branches and
      foliage, seldom, if ever, waiting for some apparently witless insect to
      manifest itself as our Pewees do. The strictly oscine character of the
      tarsal scutellæ or plates, and the existence of nine primary
      wing-feathers, are sufficient to distinguish them from the latter,
      notwithstanding the orange or yellow crown of some of its members. These
      birds&mdash;the <i>Setophagmae</i> of naturalists&mdash;have their
      greatest development in tropical America, where no less than nine genera
      and sub-genera are known to exist. Only two of them extend into the United
      States, and of the genus of Redstarts, we have but one of the many that
      have been described. This species, to which allusion has just been made,
      has an extended distribution, but chiefly in Eastern North America. It has
      been found from the Atlantic westward to Utah, and from Florida to Fort
      Simpson in British America. Throughout the river bottoms of the Missouri,
      according to various observers, it is one of the most abundant of summer
      occupants, and is also to be found quite frequently as a breeder in the
      foot-hills west of Denver. Mr. Allen, who is our authority for this
      statement, believes it to be sparingly represented in this region wherever
      woodlands exist. In the mountains it was not observed beyond the limit of
      8000 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of its arrival is usually about the first of May, never later in
      the latitude of Philadelphia than the 8th, and occasionally as early as
      the 20th of April in certain seasons; in New England from the first to the
      10th of May, but not before the last of this month in the moss-clad
      willows of the marshes that skirt the far Saskatchewan. The red lining of
      its wings as it flits through the sombre foliage of the trees in pursuit
      of insects renders it an object of attraction, and one to be easily
      recognized. Were this mark of identification wanting, its crisp, lovely
      notes would tell the tale of its presence, and lead the pursuer at once to
      its whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song of the Redstart resembles very closely that of the Black and
      White Creeper, but differs in being less prolonged, and in its quicker,
      sharper intonation. It may be very appropriately represented by the
      syllables <i>tsi-tsi-tsiwe</i>, the last ending rather abruptly. Its
      ordinary call is a simple <i>tsich</i>, which is heard at long and
      irregular intervals. Singular to say, these sounds are most frequent when
      the bird is most active, and not while in the enjoyment of the quietude
      which follows such a life. At such times our hitherto energetic friend
      maintains the utmost silence. Being an extremely early riser, it is in the
      cool, calm hours of the morning, ere all Nature is astir, that he regales
      the listening spirits of the groves with his sweetest music. About four
      o'clock he awakes from his slumber, arranges his toilet with care, and
      with a happy heart starts out to breakfast. But few of his neighbors are
      up, and for a while he has everything his own way. For nearly five hours
      he is a busy gleaner. Fastidious in appetite, he does not accept whatever
      he meets with, but prefers his viands to be of the very best that the
      great market of the world possesses. While beetles are devoured when other
      articles are not convenient, there is manifestly a strong predilection for
      the juicier fly and moth, or the honey-bearing aphis.
    </p>
    <p>
      A remarkable peculiarity of this species whilst feeding deserves a passing
      notice in this connection. We allude to its habit of opening and closing
      the wings, and of expanding the feathers of the tail. Whether these
      movements are done for show or not, we are unable to say. They cannot be
      considered as designed solely for attracting the sexes to each other,
      which would doubtless be the correct interpretation if they were practised
      only during the season of mating. But as they are to be noticed throughout
      the entire stay of these birds, and always while engaged in feeding, it
      seems to us that they are expressive of delight and satisfaction. The
      capture of an insect evokes them, and from being habitual, it is no more
      than natural to suppose that the sight of a loved one&mdash;the partner of
      former joys and sorrows&mdash;would produce feelings akin, but stronger,
      and lead to similar manifestations. Unlike what is customary among birds,
      the female Redstart rivals the male in powers of song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never gregarious, for three weeks and more from the time of arrival the
      sexes lead solitary lives, and spend the time in feeding. At first their
      foraging is confined to high, open woods, but as the days flit by, they
      become more friendly and visit orchards and lawns, or glean among the
      trees that line our roads and lanes. They now become quite tame, and may
      be approached with comparative ease. In the procurement of food they are
      as often found upon the upper branches of trees as upon the lower, and do
      not deem themselves too proud to come down to lower growths, or betake
      themselves to the ground. As the males are the first to show themselves,
      it is to be presumed that they are the earliest to migrate. They seem to
      be several days in advance of the females. But perhaps the latter are more
      modest and retired, and do not emerge from their sylvan quarters as soon
      as their lords, which would account for their apparent delay. But whether
      or not they arrive together, it is evident that they pay little regard to
      each other for a fortnight, and only care for selfish gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      This condition of things continues until the last of May or the beginning
      of June, when the males seek out their partners, and prepare for the work
      which has called them through many a weary league of country. From the
      time of mutual recognition until the construction of the nest, affairs
      progress with wonderful rapidity. The selection of a building-spot, as
      also does the labor of building, depends upon the female. She is rather
      whimsical, and, above all, hard to please. The male occasionally assists,
      but things often go wrong, and rather than provoke a tempest, he takes a
      position where he can inspect the work as it progresses under the critical
      eye, and by the skilful manipulations of his steady, industrious and
      persevering housewife. While for these long, weary days she is thus
      occupied with the structure, her partner sweetens the <i>ennui</i> of her
      life by an agreeable ditty and words of endearment. As if to show his
      appreciation of her exertions, he now and then rewards her with one of his
      choicest captures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dense woods with plenty of underbrush are generally chosen when nesting.
      Occasionally, through some freak of the builders, the domicile is placed
      contiguous to human habitations. Almost any small tree or bush answers for
      its support. A crotch receives the fabric and renders it secure from
      violent storms of wind. Upon first examination it seems to be the
      counterpart of the home of the Summer Yellow-Bird, but this impression is
      soon abandoned when a comparison is instituted. A typical structure before
      us, which was built upon a forked branch of the wild plum, at a height of
      ten feet from the ground, is composed of the fibres of the wild flax, with
      a few spiders' webs, on the outside, and is lined with a profusion of
      horse-hairs. In diameter it measures two and three-fourths inches, and
      three in height. The width of the cavity is two inches, and the depth one
      and five-eighths. The whole affair is beautifully hemispherical, and
      neatly and compactly woven.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the construction of the nest there is visible a marked uniformity in
      character, although the materials vary with the localities. Shreds of
      savin-bark, bits of wool, strips of bark, thistle-down, bits of paper, and
      other fragments are sometimes utilized in the periphery, while vegetable
      fibres, pine leaves, dry grasses and wool of plants are made to do good
      service in adding a warm and comfortable lining. From what we read it
      seems that the Redstart does not always build directly upon a branch, but
      is occasionally prone to make use of the nest of some other species as a
      foundation. A case is cited by Dr. Breaver where the Redstarts had placed
      their nest upon a Blue-eyed Warbler's, which had either been deserted, or
      from which the rightful owners had been expelled. The base of this fabric
      was composed of brownish wool plucked from fern leaves, with a commingling
      of herbaceous stems and leaves. Within this wonderfully unique structure
      was placed an entirely distinct nest, firmly and elaborately interwoven of
      pine needles, stems of grasses and long, slender ribands of bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oviposition is closely attendant upon nest-completion, and proceeds at the
      rate of one egg daily, until the entire set is laid. Incubation
      immediately follows, and is the exclusive duty of the female for eleven
      days. While this is going on, the male bird busies himself with the
      food-matters? and is a very thoughtful and attentive provider. When not
      employed in this business, he shows his regard and solicitude by remaining
      at home. In times of danger he never shirks his responsibility, but comes
      boldly to the front, and by his clamors and menacing gestures endeavors to
      frighten the intruder away. Bold and courageous he will often dart with
      wide-open jaws into the face of the person who dares to disturb his nest
      or mate. So strongly attached to her nest, on the other hand, is the
      ladybird, that she will permit a near approach thereto before abandoning
      it. In times of assault she is less demonstrative, and when her nest is
      despoiled before her eyes, expresses but a moderate show of distress. But
      while the paternal head of the household can be so deeply concerned for
      the welfare of his family, and the preservation of his home, it is a
      noteworthy fact that even while bewailing her misfortunes in the most
      agonizing manner possible, the mother-bird is often known to stop in the
      midst of her lamentations to seize a passing insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are objects of the ten derest solicitude, both parents laboring
      with unremitting zeal in providing them with plenty of suitable
      nourishment. Young caterpillars and the larvæ of various other insects
      which the parents often procure at great distances, are fed to them when
      quite young, but later on they are subsisted upon plant lice, small
      spiders and mature diptera and ants. Late in the season both young and old
      devour great quantities of cedar berries, and the seeds of the commoner
      grasses. When twelve days old the young leave the nest for the first time,
      but are not prepared to quit entirely until a week older. They now in
      company with their parents repair to moist rather than dry thickets,
      because of the greater abundance of insects to be found in such places,
      and here they remain until the last of September, when they retire south
      to winter in Guatemala, and other parts of Central America, as well as in
      the West Indies and Peru.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the time of departure, the young male resembles in plumage the
      mother, but differs in having the upper tail-coverts and tail a deep black
      color, instead of having the former olive and the latter dusky. In
      addition the dorsal region is more greenish-olive, and the abdomen and
      crissum of a purer white. He is slow in acquiring the perfect adult
      plumage, and does not attain to it until his third year. At or about this
      time his predominant color is black. This is variegated by the white
      abdomen and under tail-coverts, and by a central band on the breast of the
      same color, and still further by the bases of all the quills (excepting
      the inner and outer proximal halves of all the tail-feathers but the
      middle,) a patch on each side of the breast, and the axillary region,
      being of an orange-red hue, which shades to a vermilion on the breast. The
      female has the black replaced by olive-green above, and brownish-white
      below. Yellow takes the place of orange, and ash that of black upon the
      head. There is also a grayish-white line and ring around the eye. Their
      length is five and a quarter inches, wing two and a half, and tail two and
      nine-twentieths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of the Redstart are four in number, and bear some resemblance to
      those of the common Blue-eyed Yellow Warbler. Their groundcolor is a
      grayish-white, and this is quite thickly sprinkled all over, but more
      especially about the larger extremity, with shades of brown and black.
      They vary in length from .54 to .67 of an inch, and in breadth from .44 to
      .53. Specimens from widely separated localities, when compared with others
      from the Middle Atlantic States, show the same amount of variation in size
      and general appearance. In Eastern Pennsylvania the species is
      single-brooded, and the same may be said of other sections of the country
      which the birds frequent.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hroughout the
      temperate regions of North America few species among our nocturnal birds
      of prey have a wider distribution. In New England, and the Middle,
      Southern and Western sections of our country, it is more or less common,
      but on the Pacific as far north as Sitka, it gives place to a different
      and well-marked variety, one whose habits are not materially dissimilar to
      our Eastern form. McIlwraith gives it as a resident in portions of Canada,
      near Hamilton and around Montreal, but further north, if it appears at
      all, it is notably scarce. In the Arctic regions it is evidently unknown,
      if the failures on the part of Richardson and others to mention it in
      their travels afford any basis of judgment. Towards the extreme limits of
      its range there is reason to believe that it prevails in smaller numbers
      than elsewhere. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where its habits have been
      especially studied by the author, it is our most abundant species.
    </p>
    <p>
      It courts rather than shuns human society. In some rural districts this
      familiarity is more manifest than in others, particularly where unduly
      harassed by boys and equally offensive birds. The immense good which these
      Owls accomplish in the destruction of vermin should command for them
      proper respect, but the most cruel persecutions are the only reward which
      they receive. The evil which some of their less scrupulous and larger
      brethren commit, reflects upon them, and they, through ignorance and
      superstition, are made the scape-goats for a multiplicity of sins. But
      fortunately there are localities where they are held in high estimation by
      persons of sense and education, and amply recompensed. Here they become
      remarkably unsuspicious, nesting and roosting in hollow trees, and even
      venturing into barns and out-buildings to spend the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      More eminently nocturnal than any of its kind, it does not emerge from its
      darksome quarters until the day has expired, and gloomy night has assumed
      the rod of empire. In the uncertain twilight a few individuals, pressed by
      hunger, may often be seen abroad, but it is not until every trace of day
      has been obliterated that we find the majority on the wing, in noiseless
      pursuit of game. When aroused during the daytime its movements are
      somewhat dubious, and it acts very much like a child who has been awakened
      from a sound sleep in the midst of a brilliantly-lighted room. In cloudy
      weather less difficulty is experienced, and its actions are freer. Young
      birds seem to be better adapted to sunlight than their parents. May it not
      be that the constant habit of sleeping during the day, consequent upon a
      night's carousal, has so weakened the visual organs as to render them
      ill-fitted for day-toil? Animals, accustomed to diurnal occupations,
      suffer considerable inconvenience for a while when compelled to work at
      night. A return to day-labor is attended, though perhaps in a less degree,
      by the same discomfort. The irides undoubtedly habituate themselves to a
      reversal of habit. It is a notorious fact that the young of the
      Great-horned Owl can endure the intense light of the sun almost equally
      with the Eagle, although being mainly nocturnal in habits. It is brought
      about by the voluntary, rather than the automatic, movements of the iris.
      This fact associated with the already mentioned circumstance in the
      history of the present species, strongly favors the hypothesis that all
      our Owls can in time adapt themselves to a change of habit <i>pari passu</i>
      with visual modification, as instanced in the case of the Day Owl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appetitive gratification is the sole engrossing thought of these birds
      outside of the mating season. While they devote much of their time veering
      through the atmosphere in quest of insects which contribute largely to
      their diet, still they do not deem themselves too aerial to descend to the
      earth at times when some purpose is to be subserved. They are fond of low
      meadows, and even premises adjoining barns, barracks, etc., where they
      make terrible onslaughts upon the small quadrupeds which infest such
      places. Sailing above the tall grasses, the smallest creature is readily
      descried, and almost in the twinkling of an eye is captured and borne away
      in the vice-like bill, or firm grasp of the more powerful claws. When
      pressed for food they often conceal themselves behind tufts of grasses,
      and await the appearance of their quarry, or even visit our smaller birds
      upon their perches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nightly rampage of the Mottled Owl is always heralded by a peculiar
      plaintive cry which strongly resembles the whinings of young puppies. It
      alternates from high to low, and is occasionally varied by deep guttural
      trills. From dusk until the clock has ushered in the wee hours of the
      morning the ear of night is startled by these lugubrious utterances. By
      some they are supposed to be intended as a summons from the female to her
      partner, and <i>vice versa</i>. As they are chiefly heard while in pursuit
      of prey, it is more than probable that they are designed to startle small
      birds from their coverts, and thus insure their easy capture. The
      representation of the notes may be quite accurately expressed by <i>wha-a-a-a-a</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life without variety soon becomes monotonous, and in the case of the human
      animal often leads to unpleasant results. With birds the dreary autumnal
      and wintry days, which are spent in sleep and in contriving means for
      obtaining a subsistence, are no longer a source of enjoyable pleasure when
      spring returns, and we discover when the proper time arrives that
      everywhere there exists a feeling to throw off the shackles of such an
      existence, and to take on newer relationships. This varies with the
      character of the weather. During favorable seasons the time is earlier,
      but when the advancing steps of milder days are retarded by frosts and
      snows, there is sometimes a delay of a fortnight. Not so with the Mottled
      Owls. The period of mating with them usually begins quite early, on or
      about the fifteenth of March in extreme southern latitudes, but as late as
      the tenth of April in cooler northern sections. In the Middle Atlantic
      States the time varies from the twentieth of March to about the fifth of
      the succeeding month. It is then that the sexes manifest more than the
      usual affection for each other. Their courtship is brief, and business is
      entered into without the display of any of those amusing antics which
      pre-eminently mark the smaller oscines. The males, according to our
      experience, seem to select the same partners on each recurrence of the
      breeding-time, where not debarred by various fortuitous circumstances. As
      a proof of this position, we might instance a case. In the vicinity of
      Philadelphia a pair of birds once laid claim to a particular tree on the
      premises of a kind-hearted gentleman, who would not suffer them to be
      disturbed. The breeding-season being over, the female retained possession
      of the cavity which she had used while rearing her young, and the male
      sought shelter in the same clump of trees, but in a different hollow. As
      these were the only birds in that locality, and were observed to occupy
      the same spot for two successive years, there can be no reason to dispute
      the above question. By the law of analogy, we presume that others do
      likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pairing having been solemnized, the sexes now set to work to re-furnish
      their domicile. In the case of young birds some time is spent in looking
      up a suitable hollow of requisite capacity. When preference is shown for
      an orchard, the apple-tree is selected, especially if it is in close
      proximity to a farmyard. In other situations, almost any of the species of
      oaks is made to do good service. The hole generally chosen is one which
      had been previously wrought by the Golden-shafted Woodpecker at
      considerable pains. Where this does not exist, a decayed stump is rendered
      available. The cavity is placed at varying heights, which seem dependent
      upon the character of the neighborhood. In wooded regions nests are placed
      at elevations of forty feet and upwards, while in localities contiguous to
      human habitations, a greater height than ten feet is scarcely reached, and
      some are never placed more than five or six feet from the ground. The
      lining of the cavity consists of a few dry leaves and grasses, with an
      upper stratum of feathers. These are mostly placed in the bottom, and do
      not extend for any great distance along the peripheral walls. In some
      instances the materials constituting their bed are thrown promiscuously
      into the hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having provided herself with comfortable quarters, the female commences to
      deposit her eggs, one a day, until the number is reached which is to
      constitute her charge. Incubation at once ensues, and continues for
      fifteen days. This is chiefly the labor of the female, although the male
      sometimes relieves her when she is in quest of food. When with eggs or
      young the approach of an enemy is greeted with a sort of hissing sound,
      and the protrusion of the hand into the nest meets with a sharp reception.
      If surprised in the daytime, these birds are such stupid, sleepy creatures
      that your approach is scarcely noticed. A sort of vacant stare, with
      occasional rapid blinkings, save when partially aroused to consciousness
      by a sudden thrust with the finger, is the only recognition which they
      give. But when disturbed with such rudeness they open wide the eyes in a
      staring manner, throw back the head, and utter a loud hiss of indignation
      or disgust, which is quickly followed by the elevation and protrusion of
      the claws of the right foot. All this is of momentary duration, and is
      quickly succeeded by the same stolid indifference as manifested before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are vigorous feeders, and tax the time and energies of the
      parents to the utmost in the procurement of suitable nourishment. All
      night long the latter are constantly on the go, both birds being
      frequently absent together upon this important mission. Small quadrupeds,
      birds, lizards and insects are a few of the articles which contribute to
      their fare. At first these are torn into pieces by the parents, and fed to
      them, but as they increase in age, the entire animal is deposited in the
      burrow. Mr. Nuttall cites a case where a full supply of Bluebirds,
      Blackbirds, and Sparrows was thrown into the nest&mdash;a striking
      illustration of the provident habits of the parents. When five weeks old
      the young leave the nest and receive their rations while clinging to the
      tree-branches. A fortnight later they are able to hunt for themselves, but
      at the dawn of morning suspend operations and quietly retire to their
      homes. In the course of events they are obliged to forsake the
      family-roof, and to seek quarters in hollow trees, the gloomy recesses of
      dense forests, or the dark corners of out-buildings. The characteristic
      plumages of the young, which they attain in about four months from the
      time of hatching, vary, and are entirely independent of age, sex; or
      season, being purely individual. There can be no doubt about this
      statement, since in the same nest there may often be observed both gray
      and red young ones, while their progenitors may either be both red or both
      gray, the male red and the female gray, or the reverse. The peculiar notes
      of the adults are assumed at the same time. But the claws have scarcely
      acquired their normal development until nearly two months more have been
      added to their age. In the drawing the rufescent and normal plumages of
      the adults are so well delineated that no description seems necessary.
      Specimens from different localities show marked variations in dimensions,
      but those from which the drawings were made, have a length of nine and a
      half inches, with wing six and seven-tenths, and tail three and one-half.
      Young of the normal dress have the secondaries, primary and tail as in the
      adult, but the latter more mottled, and the bands confused. The rest of
      the plumage is grayish-white, and marked with numerous transverse
      dusky-brown bars. The eyebrows and lines are a dull white, with scarce a
      variegation, and the facial circle obsolete. In the other plumage the
      wings and tail are as in the adult birds. Upon the head and body the
      markings are as in the young gray bird, but the white bars are more
      reddish, and the darker ones a more decided brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species are from five to six in number, almost spherical,
      and of a pure white color. Specimens from different localities offer
      marked variations in size. Those from Florida are smaller than more
      northern specimens, and measure 1.31 by 1.15 inches. Xew England eggs
      average 1.49 by 1.31, and others from Pennsylvania and New Jersey 1.35
      inches in length, and 1.18 in width. On comparison with some from Michigan
      and Iowa we can find but slight differences.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>f its delightful
      winter quarters in the South, and the tropical climes of Guatemala and
      Cuba with their strange and varied forms of life, this handsome little
      species takes its adieu when the climate in our northern States warrants
      such a procedure, and spreads itself across the continent to and slightly
      beyond our northernmost borders. With the first slight frosts of November
      it takes its departure, to renew our acquaintance again when the
      delicate-footed May has returned to beautify the earth. These autumnal
      migrations are often performed during calm, clear nights, when their cries
      can be distinctly heard overhead. Persons, while "bobbing" for eels at
      night, have often been startled from their contemplations by the alighting
      of Rails in the water close-by, and the din produced as they paddle their
      way into the adjoining weeds. Their departure is seemingly more sudden
      than their advent, their appearance in diverse latitudes happening at
      regular intervals. From their feebleness of wing, it might be conjectured
      that flight is slow and labored, but experience teaches that it is
      accomplished with comparative ease and freedom, even in the face of a very
      strong wind. But these birds are best seen in the exercise of their
      cursorial powers, which the perfect development of their legs and feet,
      and the compressed, attenuated shape of the body are admirably adapted to
      promote. Even the bill, with its sharpened outline, which is wisely formed
      to cut the opposing air, lends its aid in facilitating advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the borders of salt marshes, but generally in fresh-water, it may be
      fouud upon its arrival. In such places it is a busy gleaner, feeding less
      upon vegetable, but more upon animal, diet than any of its illustrious
      congeners. Its bill of fare consists of worms, the larvae of insects, and
      small shell-fish, which it extracts from the mud, a feat which it most
      successfully and adroitly accomplishes by means of its great length of
      bill. This strong partiality to animal diet tends to render its flesh less
      savory than that of the Carolina Rail whose food is principally the
      nutritious seeds of various kinds of grasses. In the dexterity with which
      it conceals itself among the reeds and sedges of its favorite haunts when
      hunted, and its seeming aversion to flight, it is the exact counterpart of
      the latter species. In fact there are few traits of character which are
      not common to them both. When distance intervenes between the observer and
      either species, it requires considerable judgment to make the necessary
      discrimination. A little experience, however, soon enables the working
      naturalist to do so without much difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      While chiefly diurnal in habits, there is good reason for believing all
      Rails to be partially nocturnal, especially during moonlight nights. At
      such times they are on the <i>qui vive</i>, and from the tall, motionless
      bullrushes and reeds among which they harbor, the ear of the nightly
      pedestrian is startled by the peculiar notes of these birds as they pursue
      their gastronomic occupations, securely hidden from view by interlacing
      grasses. The movements of these birds would hardly enable you to locate
      their presence, so noiselessly are they executed. It is to the loud, lusty
      <i>crik-crik-rik-k-k-k</i> of some wide-awake fellow as he patrols his
      favorite marshes that we are apprised of his whereabouts and presence.
      Instantly the strain is taken up first by one and then another, until the
      very reeds shake and tremble, as it were, under the impulsive influence. A
      silence then ensues, which is unbroken save by the heavy croaking of some
      disconsolate frog as he tunes his pipe to the shrill falsetto of a
      love-lorn cricket. But the time thus spent is comparatively short. Other
      considerations demand attention. Scarcely two weeks from the time of their
      arrival, the males seek out their partners, pledge their troth anew, and
      lead the way into some bog or morass, where they are not long in making a
      selection of a suitable spot in which to deposit their nest. In the matter
      of position the male yields due deference to the judgment of his wife. She
      having decided upon the spot, which may be either a tussock of grass, the
      bare ground, or a pile of drift-weed, both birds set assiduously to work
      to construct their nest. This is merely a pile of weeds or grass, arranged
      very compactly, but with little display of taste or design, and hollowed
      out to the depth of an inch and a half by the bodily evolutions of the
      builders. Occasionally, a ground-floor of coarse grasses is laid, and upon
      this is reared a superstructure of yellowish grasses, which reminds one of
      the home which the Bobolink is accustomed to build. A few hours of labor
      at least are all that are necessary to construct one of these domiciles.
      Wilson mentions a nest that was placed in the bottom of a tuft of grass,
      and rendered almost inaccessible by the boggy character of the locality.
      It was composed entirely of old wet grass and rushes. A north-east storm
      visiting the spot, and an extraordinary rise of tide following, the eggs
      were floated out, and lay stranded upon the drift-weed. The female being
      so strongly attached to her home, still lingered near, and permitted
      herself to be taken by the hand, without showing so much as the least
      timidity, much less any exhibition of indignation or disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of eggs laid ranges from six to ten. These are deposited in
      daily instalments of one, the first being usually extruded on the third
      day subsequent to the completion of the nest. The female takes to the nest
      almost immediately after the last egg is laid, and continues for a term of
      fifteen days, when, through her constant, persevering efforts, a little
      family of children, dressed in suits of blackish down, come forth to
      gladden the hearts of both parents. The male seems to take no direct part
      in the incubating process, not even so much as to see that his faithful
      wife is not in want of food. The care of the young devolves also upon her,
      and when they are endangered, she manifests the most intense solicitude,
      and seeks by all the devices known to her nature, to lead them into places
      of safety. Like many smaller, but more courageous species, she is not
      known to wage a warfare in their defence, but endeavors by strategy, and
      at the risk of her own life, to save these jewels of her affection&mdash;these
      pledges of her regard&mdash;from the snares of the fowler. As soon as
      hatched, or shortly afterwards, the young are able to quit the nest, and
      hide themselves among the grass. Their food consists of worms, insects and
      seeds of grasses, which they procure in situations which they frequent. In
      their earliest stage the mother helps them to find the essential articles,
      pretty much after the fashion of the Quail, but as they grow, her
      responsibility is in a measure abated, and they are left to their own
      resources. In about four or five weeks they withdraw themselves from her
      sheltering care entirely, but continue to dwell in the same haunts until
      the severity of the weather calls them to warmer climes, when both young
      and old leave together. Their departure is almost unheralded by vocal
      manifestions, and is slowly executed, the birds stopping from their
      migrations, at times, to attend to the demands for food. So the journey
      often requires a fortnight, and even longer time, for its completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the retiring habits of these birds, and their tendency to settle in
      almost inaccessible meadows and swamps&mdash;the most secluded and
      farthest recesses of which they seek when approached&mdash;it is not
      surprising that they should be deemed less common than they are in actual
      reality. When better understood they will be shown to be in other sections
      as abundant breeders as they are in New England and the Middle Atlantic
      States. When observed, which is rarely the case, they stand or run with
      the tail erect. A peculiar jerking of this appendage upwards, is a
      noticeable feature which gives them a somewhat comical appearance. In
      flight the legs hang as is usual with waders, and are not tucked up, so to
      speak, as in the case of our smaller land species. They fly to a short
      distance, and at the moment of alighting, run off with remarkable speed, a
      movement which the depending position of the feet enables them to
      accomplish with comparative ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the resemblance which obtains between the eggs of this species and
      those of the Clapper Rail, that were it not for the much smaller size of
      the former, they could not be readily discriminated therefrom. In form,
      color and markings they are such perfect counterparts, that they seem to
      be the same in miniature. Their form is ovoidal, and they are marked with
      reddish-brown and obscure spots of lilac, the former predominating, upon a
      deep buff, or creamy background. They vary somewhat in dimensions, even in
      specimens from the same locality. In New England eggs are found which
      range from 1.31 to 1.52 of an inch in length, and from .90 to .95 in
      width. Others from Pennsylvania have an average measurement of 1.28 by
      .94; from New Jersey, 1.20 by .95. From the Carolina Rail, which they
      approach in size, they may be readily distinguished by the color, a fact
      which all amateurs would do well to bear in mind. A careful observance of
      the difference in the two grounds, which in the Carolina Rail is a
      yellow-drab, with a faint olivaceous tinge, will prevent the one from
      being mistaken for the other. In regard to the number of broods annually
      raised there may be some difference of opinion. Wilson thought that the
      species was double-brooded. He was led to this opinion by having come into
      possession of young birds, a few days old, in the month of July. But these
      may have been the first hatching of birds whose early efforts had been
      prevented by tidal overflows, or some other of the numerous disasters,
      which are the natural concomitants of boggy situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing represents a nest of this species, typical in character, and
      placed in position. The eggs are of the natural size and figured in the
      foreground, while the birds are diminished and put in the distance. The
      birds are exhibited in proper colors, and may be easily identified. The
      upper parts are olivaceous-brown, the monotony of which is relieved by
      longitudinal stripes of brownish-black. The throat is white, fore-part of
      the neck and breast bright-rufous, abdomen and under tail coverts
      transversely banded with black and white, the former being the broader;
      upper wing coverts bright rufous-chestnut and the under wing coverts with
      transverse white lines upon a field of black. These sombre colors are
      rendered less irksome by the presence of a reddish-white line from the
      base of the bill over the eye, and by the bright-red iris. The female
      differs but slightly from the male in being slightly shorter, and in
      having the breast of a paler hue. The white on the chin and the throat
      appears also to be more conspicuous and fuller. The total length of the
      male, from tip of bill to extremity of tail, is seven and three-quarter
      inches; the wing is four, and the tail about one and a half.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>eautiful, active
      and intelligent, this species claims superiority over most of its fellows,
      and is an object of interest and admiration to the enthusiastic student.
      It should be better known among the masses, as few birds are more sociable
      and confiding, and, on first appearance, none display stronger attachment
      to man. It visits his fields and by-ways, in company with the Sparrows,
      and makes itself at home. But as the season advances, and the time of
      nesting draws near, such places are forsaken for quieter retreats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout its extended range, which embraces the whole of the United
      States from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada and Nova Scotia, and from the
      Atlantic to the Western Ocean, it displays the same peculiar habits which
      we observe in Eastern Pennsylvania. It combines the attributes of the
      Titmice with those of the Flycatchers, moving in and out the foliage and
      branches of bushes with great dexterity, sometimes hanging from the latter
      with head downward, in its search for food, or, perched upon a small twig,
      seizing a passing insect with equal ease and skill. Whilst feeding it is
      not strictly arboreal. Individuals sometimes betake themselves to the
      ground, and glean among the dead leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although occasionally found in cultivated grounds, where its presence is
      due to the noxious insects which there abound, yet a stronger preference
      is manifested for wild uncultivated fields, especially such as are
      overgrown with briers and low bushes. Low lands are more attractive than
      high, the tendency to humidity always insuring a greater supply of
      favorite food-stuffs. Its immense service in the destruction of injurious
      grubs, which contribute largely to its fare, would make it a desirable
      companion to have about us, but its humble mode of life exposes it to
      dangers from prowling cats and vicious boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in quest of game its presence is always indicated by the peculiar cry
      it emits, which resembles that of the Summer Yellow-Bird. These notes are
      expressed in lively, quick succession, and sound like the syllables <i>wht-whi-ti-têê-têë</i>.
      In a state of inactivity, a simple <i>twich</i> is all that escapes the
      hitherto agile creature, and is uttered in such a low voice as to more
      than half impress the listener that the bird is weary after its long,
      protracted search, or is verging towards that state when the spirit is
      well-nigh overcome by sleep. It is during these foraging exploits that our
      friend's character is seen in its best light. It is not the timid bird
      that one is disposed to consider it when watching its backward and forward
      movements among low shrubbery on such occasions. It will permit a near
      approach by man, even when resting from its labors, and displays not more
      than half the suspicion which birds ordinarily do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most Warblers, this species regulates its coming, in a measure, by
      the character of the season. When the spring is early, we have known it to
      arrive during the last of April. Ordinarily its appearance is noticed from
      the first to the tenth of May. In California, where the climate is more
      uniform than in the East, birds have been seen in migration on the
      seventeenth of April; but in New England, where mild weather is retarded
      by meteorological causes, their advent does not occur until the beginning
      of the succeeding month. As is common with most other birds, the sexes do
      not arrive singly, except in occasional instances, but always in pairs,
      which seems to warrant the supposition that mating had been solemnized in
      the land of their winter's sojourn preparatory to leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      So little is the attention engrossed-by feeding, that the male does not
      appear to be utterly unmindful of his partner, as is sometimes the case
      with other species. Should one or the other stray away, the bird that
      first becomes apprised of the separation, signals the fact, which is
      instantly responded to by its companion. Directed by the sounds, they soon
      come together, and renew operations as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks thus spent suffice to blunt the keen edge of appetite. The
      male is the first to announce his weariness of such a life. In a few
      quaint syllables, cognizant to his partner, and perhaps to some of his
      nearest kin, he states his desire, and awaits her approach. Does she
      hesitate? In the same lively and pleasing manner he repeats it, this time
      with greater fullness and variation. Again and again he does the same, and
      at last his efforts are crowned with success. Pleased with his charming
      voice, she yields to his pertinacious coaxings, and desists from her
      labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song of the males, for <i>such</i> naturalists have been pleased to
      designate the language which the lords of the feathered creation are prone
      to deliver to their intended partners on certain occasions, bears a strong
      resemblance at first to the song of the Summer Yellow-Bird. But when at
      its height, about the fifteenth of May, the likeness is not so marked. It
      consists merely of a few short syllables, repeated rather quickly but
      uniformly, and with a loud, clear, distinct and ringing intonation. In
      syllabic language it may be somewhat accurately represented by <i>têê-whit-ti-têë-whït-t'î-têë-whit-ti.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      As fond as this species seems to be of cultivated grounds whilst feeding,
      we have never known it, from personal observation, to build in similar
      situations. For purposes of nesting it generally seeks the retirement of
      woods where there is a dense growth of bushes, or waste fields where
      brambles are quite abundant. Occasionally the nest occupies the centre of
      a huge skunk-cabbage, or a tussock of grass, in the midst of a swamp, or
      alongside of a stream of fresh water. In certain localities moist places
      are chosen rather than elevated ones. In others the converse is true. Even
      in the same locality, the birds manifest a preference one year for
      lowlands, and the very next for those which are high and dry. Perhaps the
      character of the season does much in rendering these changes necessary. A
      wet spring, if long and protracted, would, by increasing the amount of
      water in swampy situations above the average, make them undesirable
      resorts, and thus drive the birds to the necessity of seeking less humid
      and less exposed places. At such times, high grounds, by obtaining more
      than the usual amount of moisture, would become suited to the existence of
      insects, which form no mean part of their living. In dry seasons, moist
      localities would be chosen, as they are more advantageously situated for
      obtaining supplies of food than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest is almost invariably placed upon the ground, in a thick bed of
      dry leaves, in a clump of grass, at the roots of low bushes, or under the
      shelter of a pile of brush, sometimes being covered by surrounding leaves,
      and quite as often exposed from above. When built directly upon the
      ground, it occupies a depression thereof; but when built in a tussock,
      this precaution is not taken, as the necessary security is afforded by the
      enveloping grasses or sedges. According to Dr. Brewer, nests are
      occasionally found four or five feet from the ground, among the matted
      branches of high weeds. A typical nest consists of loose leaves on the
      outside, which are held in position by the walls of the cavity in which
      they are placed, or by surrounding grasses. Within is placed a
      superstructure of dry grasses, twigs, strips of dry bark, and leaves of
      sedges. The lining consists of fine strips of the bark of the chestnut and
      wild grape vine, which are arranged with great care and compactness. In
      depth these structures vary from five to six inches, and have an external
      diameter of two and a half inches at the base, and three at the mouth. The
      cavity is usually three inches deep, and about two and a quarter wide.
      When we come to compare the entire fabric with the size of the builder, we
      are at a loss to account for the disproportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of building such a bulky domicile does not fall to the lot of the
      female solely, but is the result of the combined labor of both birds, who
      prosecute their task with commendable diligence and patience for a period
      of five days, when they are rewarded with the sight of a finished home.
      Nothing now remains to be done but to furnish the capacious apartment with
      its wee, spotted treasures. This cannot be commenced immediately, as
      sufficient time must be allowed for the walls to become properly seasoned.
      Two or three days at the utmost are all that are necessary. On the fourth
      day the female deposits her first jewel, and, where not interrupted,
      renews the same duty day by day, until she has furnished her allotted
      quota. She immediately commences the incubating process, occasionally not
      before the succeeding day, and for ten long days is thus engaged, when the
      appearance of the young reminds her that the labor is ended. While thus
      employed the male, actuated by the purest affection, administers to her
      necessities with commendable alacrity. He only forsakes her for food. When
      the nest is assailed, by the most pitiful cries and the practise of
      various ruses, he endeavors to lead his enemies away from it. His
      stratagems often succeed with the unsophisticated, but with the
      professional collector they are of little avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are carefully nurtured. Their food consists of the larvæ of
      small beetles, caterpillars of various kinds, and diptera. At the age of
      twelve days they are able to leave the nest, but remain under parental
      surveillance for a week longer, when they are obliged to shift for
      themselves, being permitted, however, to enjoy the society of their
      parents. Early in September, both young and old take their departure, the
      greater portion retiring to Mexico, Guatemala and the West Indies, while a
      few remain along our southern borders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plumage of the young bird is brownish-olive above, with a tendency to
      stronger virescence on the rump and tail. The eyelids and entire lower
      parts are a light buff, which is relieved by a tinge of yellow on breast
      and lower tail-coverts. The male in the spring is olive-green, somewhat
      grayer anteriorly, and has the forehead and a broad band through the eye
      to the neck a pure black, margined superiorly with grayish-ash. The chin,
      throat, breast, under tail-coverts and edge of wing bright yellow, passing
      into whitish in the abdominal region. The wings and tail are slightly
      olive, and devoid of marks. The bill is black, and the feet flesh-colored.
      In the female, during the same season, the crown is generally brownish,
      the black and ash on the head wanting, and the yellow of the under parts
      pale and restricted. From its congeneric brethren this species differs in
      the absence of a clear ash upon the throat. Its length is about four and
      three-fourths inches, wing two and one-fifth, and tail two and
      three-tenths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of the Yellow-Throat range from four to six in number, the
      complement doubtless depending upon locality, and the peculiarity of the
      female. In Eastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey and Delaware never
      more than four have been found in a nest, and this has been the experience
      of others from even the most widely separated localities. In color the
      eggs are a beautiful crystalline-white, and are dotted and blotched around
      the larger extremity with reddish-brown and dark umber. Specimens are
      often found with curiously-shaped lines and dashes of remarkable fineness.
      Their size varies with latitude, the largest coming from Kansas, and the
      smallest from Georgia. The average measurement of several sets from four
      different localities is .04 by .53 inches. We incline to the opinion that
      but a single brood is annually raised, although there may be instances
      where more than one has been observed. In most cases, where the birds have
      been late in rearing their young, the hasty collector, and even recorder
      of facts, may conclude that he has a sure proof of his position. Careful
      watching, carried through a decade, has convinced us that in Philadelphia
      the species is single-brooded. Like most of our smaller birds, the nest of
      this species does not escape the visits of the Cowbird, who, taking
      advantage of the absence of its owners, embraces the opportunity of
      depositing two of her own eggs, which she trusts the female Yellow-Throat
      will adopt and rear as her own.

      species inhabits the eastern portions of the United States from the
      Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains, being replaced in the territory west of
      the great central plains by a well-marked variety. In the British
      Provinces it has not been observed to attain a higher northern range than
      Nova Scotia. Although rather common in the maritime portions of its
      somewhat extended habitat, yet it is less so than in regions farther
      inland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a permanent resident among us, there is no reason why the
      enthusiastic lover of birds should not render himself familiar with its
      history. In its own native haunts, notwithstanding, the shyness which
      seems to characterize its nature, ample opportunities are afforded. From
      early morning until sunset, except when concerned with domestic relations,
      but more especially during the season when winter rules the year, its
      presence may be seen and heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When first noticed, its peculiar winding movements around the trunks and
      branches of trees, in every conceivable direction and position, cannot
      fail to rivet the attention, and excite surprise. It recalls to mind many
      of the motions which the smaller Woodpeckers and Titmice assume. To a
      novice a word of explanation as to the cause thereof may be necessary. But
      to one who has been accustomed to using his eyes and ears aright, the
      solution to the problem soon becomes apparent. The loud, sonorous tap
      against the hardened bark, and the listening attitude which the bird takes
      on, are the key to the mystery. Let but the stir of some hibernating
      insect, or the perforations of an undermining grub, be heard, and in
      almost the twinkling of an eye, its whereabouts is discovered, and the
      thoughtless culprit dragged out and made to pay the penalty of an
      inglorious death for such rashness. Quite as often the detection of food
      is due to the keen vision which these birds possess as to that of a
      well-trained ear, for in their persistent and indefatigable searchings in
      crack and crevice, the most apparently lifeless beetle, or even the
      death-like ovum of the same, does not escape their scrutinizing gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the reader, in his rural walks, visit the haunts of the Nuthatches,
      it is more than likely that his presence would be greeted by the strong
      nasal cry of <i>honk-honk</i>, which these birds are accustomed to emit,
      at somewhat regular intervals, while foraging. Not that they adopt this
      method of accosting their human brethren upon such occasions, but what we
      mean is, that the birds will be heard, in most instances, before there are
      any bodily manifestations. Even after one has located with tolerable
      precision the tree from which emanated the sounds, a few minutes will
      generally elapse before the authors thereof are clearly outlined against
      the dark background of the bark. To insure success, without waste of time,
      the eyes should be directed upward, as the middle and higher branches of
      the tallest trees are usually chosen for the purposes of feeding, the
      lowermost being seldom resorted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the larvæ of beetles, mature forms of elaters and buprestians
      constitute a large share of their winter diet. As winter lapses into
      spring, and there is a consequent increase in the numbers, as well as
      kinds of insects, their bill of fare is enlarged, certain new species of
      coleoptera and a few ants being added thereto. When the tulip-tree is in
      blossom in May, many may be seen delving into its floral treasures for the
      numerous small insects which are attracted thither. Earlier, the cone-like
      fruit is visited, and rifled of its samara-shaped seeds. By some writers
      it is claimed that, like its European congener, our species collects and
      stores away the fruits of nut-bearing trees. This is an undisputed fact,
      as different species of acorns have been seen securely wedged in between
      the bark and outer woody layers of trees, and Nuthatches in positions as
      to lead to the suspicion that they had placed them there. In fine, birds
      have been seen engaged in this identical business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their favorite food being insects, in all their different stages, where
      abundance of them exist they seldom stray for any considerable distance
      from their accustomed woods during the breeding-season. When snow or ice
      debars them from access to the trunk and branches of trees, they have been
      known to visit houses and out-buildings for the requisite food, and even
      to hunt among the leaves upon the ground of sheltered localities for the
      seeds of plants. Ordinarily dry, high thickets are preferred to the noise
      and bustle of human life. It is chiefly at such times that the sexes part
      company, and seem engrossed by the most selfish feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      While remarkably fond of the joys of the table, as evidenced by the
      industry and perseverance with which they pursue their gastronomic
      exploits, they are not so thoroughly epicurean in their lives as to forget
      the claims of affection. Their devotion to each other is nearly unbounded,
      and is scarcely excelled, if at all, by that which characterizes our
      smaller Titmice. This feeling of love, as is natural to suppose, cannot
      fail to lead to an early assumption of conjugal relations. Accordingly we
      find that preparations for this work are entered into early. About the
      time that the Warblers are beginning to make the woods and fields lively
      with their exhilarating songs and diversions, these loving, sympathetic
      beings, already mated, are beginning to look themselves out a home. Like
      the Woodpeckers and Chickadees, they sometimes excavate a hole in the
      decayed trunk or branch of a forest-tree, or in the solid wood itself.
      Usually, however, they search for one already prepared, either in the
      trunk of a tree, in the creviced wall of an out-building, or in a hollow
      rail in a fence. In any event, more or less work of construction is
      necessary. When the labor of excavation has commenced, the birds work by
      turns. The one not thus occupied waits upon its mate, and carries out the
      chips that are made, to a safe distance from the nest. The cavities thus
      made vary in depth, some being not more than ten inches deep, while others
      are nearly one and a half feet. The entrance thereto is generally wide
      enough to admit of easy entrance, but towards the bottom the cavity
      expands into a sort of room. In the North these chambers are lined with
      warm and soft materials, such as hair, feathers, wool, down and fur, which
      are loosely thrown together. Audubon affirms that they build no nest,
      which may have been true in his day, but the statement is not borne out by
      recent observations. A nest in the writer's collection, from the South,
      offers no material variation from specimens from the most northern
      localities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the selection of a cavity the birds sometimes make mistakes, as
      instanced by E. W. Nelson, Esq., in his valuable pamphlet on the Birds of
      Northeastern Illinois. In this case the Nuthatches had selected for
      nesting purposes a knot hole in a large oak, at a height of about
      twenty-five feet from the ground. The hole was large enough to admit the
      human hand, and several inches in depth. Within were the remnants of a
      squirrel's nest, which nearly filled the cavity. After working steadily
      for about a week until the nest was nearly ready for occupancy, a pair of
      flying-squirrels, the previous owners of the hollow, seized the premises,
      and the birds, despondent and aggrieved, were compelled to move elsewhere.
      Had these patient little builders been aware of the method which their
      European cousin adopts to keep out unfriendly intruders&mdash;namely, that
      of plastering up the entrance to their nest, and thus contracting the
      opening, they would have been spared the pains of seeing their nearly
      furnished compartment occupied by creatures of the remotest kinship.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the first of May, or thereabouts, the female commences to deposit her
      complement of six eggs, which she does in as many consecutive days. She
      now immediately enters upon the process of incubation, and after twelve
      days of close sitting, brings forth her tender brood. All the time that
      she is thus occupied, the male is very assiduous in his efforts to lighten
      her cares and solace her ennui. He supplies her with food, and when
      released from such labor, spends the most of his time in the vicinity of
      the nest. A score of times during the course of the day, perhaps, she is
      summoned to the mouth of the hole to receive some choice hit of food, or
      the endearments and caresses of her idolizing partner. At the approach of
      danger he does not desert her, but fearlessly intervenes to give the
      necessary warning. If the nest is disturbed, his quiet, peaceable
      disposition will not suffer him to make the slightest defence. His only
      object seems to reach some place of safety, from which, when attained, he
      can survey the contemplated demolition. With the female the case is
      different. So strongly attached to her home is she, that she is not prone
      to leave it, even under the most trying circumstances. A case is cited by
      Maynard of a nest having been found in a partially decayed apple-tree by
      Mr. Brewster. In order to effect an entrance for the hand, and thus secure
      the female, the latter gentleman was compelled to enlarge the opening. The
      bird struggled vigorously to escape, but when liberated, returned at once
      to her eggs. Several times was she taken out, and as often re-entered her
      domicile the moment she was at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both parents are strongly attached to the young, and provide them with an
      abundance of healthy food, of a somewhat varied character, which they
      receive, soon after they are hatched, by climbing to the opening of the
      nest. This food consists chiefly, at first, of different kinds of grubs;
      but after the first week, beetles and ants are fed, and relished with a
      gusto. When about two weeks old they venture out upon the trunk to try
      their legs and claws, while their wings are acquiring development and
      strength, but retire to the nest when the weather is unpleasant, and at
      nights. A few days more, and they are prepared to earn their own living,
      after the peculiar fashion of the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young male birds do not immediately put on the plumage of the paternal
      sire, and it is probable that this condition is not attained until the
      following spring. In the fall they resemble the mother, who differs from
      her lord only in having the black of the head glossed with ashy. The
      latter is ashy-blue above, with top of head and neck black. The under
      parts, and sides of the head to a brief space above the eye, are white.
      The under tail-coverts, as well as tibial feathers, are brown, while the
      concealed primaries are white. The bill is rather long, stout and
      awlshaped. The length is six inches, and the wing about three and
      three-quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs have a white ground in blown specimens, but when fresh they show
      a beautiful roseate tinge, with a tendency to a reddish hue, which is
      apparently due to the ferruginous and purplish spots and blotches with
      which they are so closely covered. Considerable variations of size prevail
      in these markings, from fine points to well-pronounced blotches, and there
      is also noticeable a predominance of the reddish-brown colors. The average
      dimensions of several sets before us, from half a dozen localities, are
      .80 by .62 inches. Single specimens may occasionally be found which, like
      Mr. Samuels's Adirondack specimen, may have a length of .70 of an inch,
      and a width of .57, but such are certainly abnormal productions. While the
      rule in our Northern States seems to be, according to the concurrent
      testimony of numerous writers, but a single brood annually, yet there is
      reason to believe that in the warm, semi-tropical sections of our country,
      the species may prove double-brooded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether our species could ever be domesticated or not, it is impossible to
      say. But there is no doubt that, under similar circumstances, the same
      confiding tameness would be shown, as the interesting descriptions given
      in English works tell us is exhibited by the European species. The latter,
      we are told, when treated with kindness, will come regularly to be fed.
      Individuals have been known to approach within a foot of their benefactor,
      and even to capture bits of food thrown to them before the latter could
      have time to reach the ground.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few years more
      this handsome bird, which was at one time found in great abundance over
      nearly the whole of the Eastern Province of the United States, will be
      numbered with the things that were. Its final extinction is only a
      question of time, and that not very remote. In the days of Audubon it was
      found along the entire range of the Alleghanies, where individuals do
      still exist, but they have been so molested by man, that they can only be
      approached with the greatest difficulty. At present they are quite
      abundant in the unsettled parts of our Southern and Western States, and in
      the regions drained by the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. In New England
      it has probably become extinct. The same may doubtless be predicated of
      portions of our Middle Atlantic States. To be sure there are localities
      where individuals may occasionally be observed, but with the construction
      of railroads, and the settlement of the country which invariably follows,
      we may expect the same fate to overtake them. Dr. Woodhouse met with the
      species in abundance in all the timbered portions of Texas and the Indian
      Territory, and Mr. Dresser found it common enough in the districts of
      Mexico and Texas which he visited. This was especially the case on the
      rivers between San Antonio and the Rio Grande.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not migratory in the sense in which many of our smaller species are, yet
      these birds are addicted to roaming from one locality to another. These
      movements always occur in flocks of varying numbers, and have reference to
      food-matters. Where the supply of mast becomes exhausted, an advance is
      ordered towards richer pastures. If there is an abundance of food, the
      large flocks dissolve into smaller ones, composed of individuals of all
      ages and sexes. A paucity of the same, brought about by deep snows,
      induces the birds to approach the haunts of man, where they obtain a
      subsistence by consorting with the poultry, or by entering the open doors
      of corn-cribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young are nearly grown, in October, the adult females&mdash;which
      dwell apart from their lords, each at the head of her numerous family&mdash;gather
      in the rich bottom-lands of our Western rivers. These families unite with
      others, until parties of seventies and eighties are the final results. The
      old males associate in parties of from twenty to a hundred, and move
      simultaneously into the same territories, but are carefully avoided by the
      mother-birds, on account of the hatred which the former bear towards their
      nearly grown children. This un parental disposition, which leads the males
      to destroy their offspring, is more especially vented upon the young
      males, and is doubtless inspired by jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The migration are mostly made on foot. But when a stream intervened; a
      stay of one or two days upon its banks occurs before any attempt is made
      to cross. The manouvres of the old males are then rather ludicrous. They
      parade themselves up and down the banks, utter to each other their
      characteristic gobble, as if to raise their courage to the point necessary
      to surmount the barrier. The females and the young assume in less degree
      the same demeanor. After this lengthy preparation, both young and old
      mount to the summit of a tall tree, and at the leader's signal, wing their
      flight for the opposite shore. Some, however, overcome by fatigue, drop
      into the water. These, with wings close-pressed to the body and expanded
      tail, call their legs into vigorous action, and soon gain the shore, where
      they are at length able to extricate themselves from the perilous
      situation. If the stream is wide, the birds are often thrown into a state
      of bewilderment, and become easy victims to the hunter's rifle. Advantage
      is not only taken of these movements, but from the fact that the birds are
      hard to approach in the daytime, many a gunner by watching where they
      roost, on clear, moonlight evenings is often able to secure two or three
      plump fellows for his trouble. Like our domestic Turkey, these birds roost
      on trees as high up as possible. Various contrivances are often adopted to
      lure them to their destruction. In the spring, a very common practise is
      to imitate the voice of the female by drawing the air through one of the
      wing-joints, the second usually, the sound produced being immediately
      answered by the male, who ventures out of his place of concealment, only
      to be shot. The cry of the Barred Owl is also imitated in localities which
      these birds frequent at night, with the most happy results. A trap known
      as a Turkey-pen is a very common mode of capture in some parts of the
      country. This is a covered enclosure, made of small trees of various sizes
      and of moderate heights. At one end a small opening is left, through which
      is dug a slight trench, sloping gradually from each extremity to the
      centre, and continued outwardly for a brief space. For a short distance
      from the enclosure a passage-way is constructed. This, with the interior
      of the pen, and a narrow tract of land stretching into the forest, is
      scattered with corn. Attracted by the grain, the birds follow it into the
      enclosure, and when once there, become bewildered, or lack the
      intelligence necessary to make their exit. While in this predicament, many
      are captured. .
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the love-season approaches, man abandons the amusements of the
      chase, and these severely persecuted creatures are allowed a chance to
      cultivate social relations. Early in February the males present their
      suits, but at first meet with little favor. Still they persist, until
      their patience is rewarded with success. When these amours commence, the
      sexes are dwelling apart. If a call is emitted by a perching female within
      hearing of a male, a response is returned in a voice akin to the sounds
      with which our domestic bird greets any ordinary noise. But let the female
      utter the same note while on the ground, and she is soon besieged by
      several of her masculine admirers, each striving to demonstrate the
      sincerity of his affection. With wide-spread, erected tails, depressed and
      quivering wings, and head gracefully poised and carried well back upon the
      shoulders, they parade themselves with great pomp in front of the females,
      who regard such movements, for the nonce, with listlessness or disfavor.
      All the while the males are thus engaged, they give expression to their
      feelings in a succession of peculiar puffs. Considerable excitement often
      attends these love-affairs. Especially is this the case when some hitherto
      listless female becomes impressed with the pleadings of a particular male.
      This is the signal for the fiercest encounters, which usually result in
      some one or more of the participants being killed. When one rival has thus
      destroyed another, the surviving party, as if feeling remorse, caresses
      the fallen one with the ten derest affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having mated, the union thus formed usually lasts during the season,
      although instances are recorded where the same male has been known to
      possess more than one partner. The female is endued with finer feelings
      than her lord and, when concerned with domestic relations, continues to
      keep her treasures hid, well knowing the propensity which he manifests for
      destroying the same. Consequently, the selection and building of a nest
      fall exclusive to her lot. At the close of the love-season, the males
      cease to gobble, and being considerably emaciated, desert the females, and
      go off by themselves. When they have recuperated their energies, they
      return, and reunite in small flocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of April the females prepare their nests in secluded
      localities. These are placed upon the ground, and consist of a few dry
      leaves placed in a depression by the side of a prostrate log, under a mass
      of brushwood in a thicket, within the precincts of a corn-brake, or in
      such places as afford the necessary shelter. Dry spots are always
      selected. Suited with locality, the female deposits her eggs daily until
      the entire complement is raised, when she enters the nest, and for nearly
      four weeks is a close sitter. When she leaves it for food, she always
      takes the precaution to cover her eggs with leaves, to guard against
      detection. Small islands are frequently chosen for nesting purposes. The
      large masses of driftwood which accumulate about their heads, are said to
      give them security from their numerous enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      So closely attached to home is the female, that she will not leave it
      unless in peril. The approach of human footsteps is unheeded, where no
      danger is to be apprehended. Its discovery by man is not considered as
      sufficient cause for desertion, but she is known to forsake it when the
      egg's have been broken. In such cases another nest is prepared, but
      otherwise only one brood is annually raised. The most friendly feelings
      are known to exist among the females during the breeding-season. Several
      hens have been known to deposit their eggs in the same nest, and rear
      their broods together. Audubon once met with forty-two eggs in a single
      nest, the labors of three females, one of whom being always on guard. When
      the eggs are nearly hatched, the female remains a very vigilant watcher,
      and will leave the nest under no circumstances. In short, she has often
      permitted herself to be captured rather than endanger her treasures. Weak,
      delicate creatures as the young are, it is doubtful that they could
      extricate themselves from their calcareous coverings, were it not for the
      timely efforts of the parent. Not only in this manner does she show her
      love, but also by fondling and drying them, and assisting them to leave
      the nest. Her cares are now quite manifold. She must needs lead them into
      suitable feeding pastures, teach them to distinguish good from bad food,
      and protect them from enemies. Besides, she is careful to keep them from
      getting wet, which is detrimental to their early lives. At the age of two
      weeks, they follow the mother with facility, roost upon the same bough
      with her at night, and seek their food in the daytime. Their diet at first
      consists of small berries of different kinds, and insects. To this
      somewhat restricted bill of fare, grass, corn, seeds, fruit, beetles,
      tadpoles and lizards are added, as they weekly mature. The dry leaves of
      the woods are turned over with their feet, for they are somewhat rasorial
      in their habits. Like their parents, the young are able to go for several
      days without food, which is occasionally the case after a heavy fall of
      snow. At such times, in the unsettled parts of our country, both young and
      old associate with domesticated birds, when quarrels often ensue, which
      chiefly result in favor of the former. Attempts to tame these birds have
      been made, but with only partial success. Under confinement birds are apt
      to lose the brilliancy of their plumage in the third generation, and
      display in places an intermingling of white feathers throughout the pale
      brown which they then assume. In the cut accurate representations of the
      sexes appear, the female differing from the male in being of smaller size,
      in having less brilliant colors, in the much smaller fleshy protuberance
      above the base of the bill, and in the absence usually of the pencil of
      bristles on the breast, and of spur. From the Mexican variety&mdash;the
      supposed parent of the tame species&mdash;it differs in having the upper
      tail-coverts chestnut, but without the light tips, and in having the ends
      of the tail feathers scarcely paler, instead of brownish-yellow or
      whitish. The male bird ranges from forty-eight to fifty inches in length,
      and weighs from sixteen to thirty-five pounds. The wing is twenty-one
      inches long, and the tail eighteen and a half. The female is smaller
      proportionally, and weighs about thirteen pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are usually from eight to fifteen in number, but sometimes amount
      to eighteen, and even twenty. They are of an elongate oval form, obtuse at
      one extremity, and pointed at the other. Their ground-color is a dark
      cream, and there are pretty generally scattered over the surface rounded
      spots of umber-brown. In dimensions they are apt to differ, even in the
      same nest-full. Specimens vary from 2.25 to 2.58 inches in length, and
      from 1.74 to 1.89 in width. In no portion of its habitat is the species
      other than single-brooded, although nests with eggs are occasionally found
      in June, but these are due to delays caused by various contingencies.

      chiefly confines its migrations to the eastern portions of North America,
      from the Atlantic westward to the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, and
      northward to the 50th parallel of latitude. In the fur-bearing countries
      it is probably a stranger, as no mention is made of it by Dr. Richardson
      in his explorations. Mr. Say met with it at Pembina, on the Red River, in
      Northern Minnesota; Mr. Allen, in great abundance, in Kansas; but it is
      doubtful as to its occurrence in New Mexico, notwithstanding the high
      authority of Dr. Woodhouse, as later observers are silent upon the
      subject. It has also been claimed by the last-mentioned traveler as being
      found in parts of Texas, but Mr. Dresser was unable to take it, and it
      does not appear that it has ever been met with by the naturalists of any
      of our Western expeditions. The accounts given by early writers of its
      presence along the Pacific region, it is now decided, pertain not to this
      species, but to a distinct and closely allied one. Respecting its
      winter-quarters we are in the dark. It is not likely that it remains in
      any portion of the United States during the autumnal and brumal months,
      not to any great extent, if it does at all, as it has been observed by
      Allen entering Florida during the latter days of March. Lawrence, Salvin
      and Sclater, as well as other writers of note on the birds of Mexico,
      Central America and the West Indies, make no mention of it. Its southern
      journey usually occurs about the middle of September, seldom later, and is
      performed with so much silence and suddenness, that we are only made aware
      of the vacancy which their departure has produced, by the missing of their
      confused yet pleasant chatterings at morn and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their vernal advent is marked with the same quietness, and is as much a
      source of mystery and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon its arrival in the United States late in March, it diffuses itself in
      various directions throughout the country, reaching the Central and
      Northern States about the middle of April usually, but, sometimes, when
      the season has been very much retarded, not before the beginning of the
      following month. Its entrance into Canada is not looked for until near the
      close of April&mdash;the birds apparently timing their movements with the
      sun's northward advancement. From Virginia to Canada, along the Atlantic
      seaboard, and the same is true of our Western States, where the presence
      of man is seen and felt, these dusky denizens of the air are wont to take
      up their abode. The chimneys of our houses, especially those that' are not
      called into constant requisition, afford them convenient and comfortable
      quarters. So accustomed to their odd little ways and notions have we
      become, that on each recurrence of the breeding-season we naturally look
      for their coming with as much interest and pleasure as to that of a long
      absent friend. Their jolly, sociable disposition wins our regard and
      esteem, and has so completely interwoven their fortunes with our own, that
      their loss would be keenly felt and universally bewailed. In habits they
      are widely different from their trans-Atlantic brethren, who display
      considerable shyness, and breed in caves, or ruined or deserted dwellings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the occupancy of this country by civilized beings, a most wonderful
      change has been effected in their behavior. Their primitive breeding
      places have been exchanged for the cosy, soot-begrimmed chimney. To be
      sure there are localities where breeding is still carried on in hollow
      trees as of yore, but such places are now but occasionally occupied in the
      older parts of the country, and merely for roosting purposes. In certain
      portions of New Brunswick, according to Mr. George A. Boardman, birds
      still nest in decayed tree-hollows. Even where chimneys are to be found
      individuals have been known to select places remote therefrom. The writer
      last mentioned once met with a nest that was built against a board in an
      old log-house. It was not the lack of a chimney that conduced to this
      peculiar deviation, as we are led to infer of the existence of one
      somewhat remotely situated from what that observer says. Where there is no
      danger to be apprehended from enemies, a position like the one described,
      affords the requisite advantages. In buildings that are freely used by
      man, persistence in this habit might be attended with results, which would
      be escaped by nidification in chimneys. In Southeastern Illinois Mr.
      Ridgway discovered a nest in a hollow sycamore-tree, and also another
      securely fastened to a plank of an out-building. Mr. Allen met it in
      Kansas, breeding in hollow trees, for which it seemed to manifest a
      decided preference. In long-settled sections the species has been forced
      by circumstances to resort to chimneys, or else abandon the country. In
      but a single instance have we known from actual experience the nest to be
      built against the rafter of a deserted out-building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nesting usually commences within a week after the birds have reached the
      accustomed haunts. Whether mating is accomplished preparatory to leaving
      their southern homes, or subsequent thereto, we are not prepared to
      assert, but incline to the belief that they arrive already paired, since
      we have never been able to observe the sexes engaged in their amours.
      Perhaps these are performed within the sheltering walls of the flues which
      they choose for their homes. The labor of nest-building requires the
      united efforts of the builders for three days. The structure is a rather
      curious and remarkable affair. Its composition consists of small twigs,
      nearly uniform in dimensions, which are severed from the living branches
      of trees, by the birds while upon wing, with considerable dexterity and
      adroitness. They sweep upon the coveted twig much after the fashion of a
      hawk in rushing upon its prey. These twigs are fastened to each other by
      the saliva of the builders, and by the same cement the entire fabric is
      made to adhere to the side of the chimney in which it is placed. This
      saliva, after a slight exposure, hardens into a glue-like material, which
      becomes as firm as the branches it joins together. In separating these
      nests from their reposing surfaces we have even known fragments of the
      bricks to give way, rather than the cementing substance. When rendered
      moist by long-continued rains, they often become precipitated to the
      bottom of the chimney solely by the weight of their own contents. In such
      emergencies the young cling with considerable tenacity to the chimney-side
      by means of bill and claw. In configuration the nest resembles a neat,
      semi-circular basket, and measures about three and a half inches in
      diameter, one and a half in width, and about one in depth. Some are found
      to exceed the above dimensions, and others to fall considerably short of
      them. Building operations are ordinarily entered into during the early
      morning hours while the air is cool, the birds then working with
      praiseworthy diligence, but seldom during the hot, summer noontide. All
      the time the work is going on the builders are the happiest of creatures,
      and judging from the continual chatter which they make, there is never an
      angry word spoken, nor a quarrel indulged in with each other, or with any
      of their near neighbors who occupy the same chimney. Their lives seem to
      be as gay and felicitous as the days are long.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days elapse after the completion of the fabric, not usually more
      than two, in which mutual congratulations are passed. Then comes the drama
      in which the female is the principal actor&mdash;namely, the laying of the
      eggs. This requires four days, in ordinary instances, one egg being
      deposited daily. Incubation then succeeds, and lasts for eleven days. Here
      the female displays her true motherly instinct. She enters the nest, and
      with unwearied perseverance continues thereon, save during brief intervals
      of absence in quest of food, until she has achieved her heart's desire.
      The male is said to relieve her, but if such is the case, we have never
      been a witness of the fact. But while keeping aloof from such fatiguing
      duty, he is nevertheless a very faithful and devoted father when the young
      have quit their narrow prison-houses and welcomed the light of a new life.
      He is now as solicitous for their safety and well-being as the mother, and
      in case of molestation, unites his cries with hers to frighten away the
      intruder, or to cause him to desist from any assault he may have in
      contemplation. When twelve days old the little Swifts are able to climb to
      the summit of the chimney and receive their food. This always occurs a few
      days before their wings are sufficiently developed for flight. Even while
      quite young, in case of accident to the nest, they are able to make their
      way to the top of the chimney. In some cases they are carried beyond the
      reach or notice of their parents. When such occur they stubbornly refuse,
      human assistance, although uttering the most pitiful cries of hunger. When
      placed upon the roof contiguous to their native chimney, Dr. Brewer has
      known them to descend to its base, and there receive parental attention.
      In a fortnight they leave the nest, and are able to care for themselves.
      As this species is double-brooded in Pennsylvania the young are
      necessarily forced to self-maintenance at an early age, the thoughts of
      the parents being engrossed with preparations for a second family. These
      arrangements are perfected about the middle of June. In New England, and
      further north, but one brood is raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the old birds, the young are crepuscular rather than nocturnal in
      their habits, preferring to hunt for their prey early in the morning and
      late in the afternoon, or during cloudy weather. At times these predatory
      excursions occur at noonday in the broad glare of a full-orbed sun. The
      period for hunting is apparently regulated by the abundance or scarcity of
      appropriate insects. The adult birds, when with young, have often been
      known to protract their search for food long after night-fall.
      Caterpillars, diptera, beetles and lepidoptera of various kinds,
      constitute their <i>menu</i>, vast numbers of injurious, as well as
      beneficial species, being destroyed. Mature insects are chiefly in demand,
      which the birds, from being constantly on the wing, procure without much
      difficulty. Their flight then is varied and difficult of description. It
      consists of rapid sailing, and divers turnings, with occasional quickly
      repeated strokes of the wings. They never rest except in their
      roosting-places, to the walls of which they cling with great tenacity,
      being partially supported by their rigid tails. When tired of flight, they
      seek their homes, which they enter by falling headforemost, without any
      apparent concern. Their only note in these gastronomic explorations is a
      simple <i>chip</i>, uttered with considerable force, and at times so
      quickly, as to give rise to a confused twittering.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of Wilson these birds were known, in the more unsettled parts
      of the country, to repose in large hollow trees, which were open at the
      top. Swallow Trees, as these roosting-places were commonly designated by
      country people, were fancifully supposed to be the winter-quarters of the
      Swifts, where, in vast heaps, they slept away the winter in a condition of
      torpidity, and whence, on the return of spring, they came forth to enliven
      us with their animated expressions. But in the present enlightened age,
      the intelligent take no stock in these statements, but consign such
      rubbish to the domain of oblivion. With the ignorant and superstitious it
      is different. They are invested with peculiar charms, which make them
      matters of pleasant reflection. Attempts have recently been made to revive
      these beliefs, but with slim chances of success. An instance may occur
      where some hapless individual has been left behind by his companions, and
      been forced to seek protection from the inclemency of the season in the
      cavities of trees, as the result of a sad emergency, which the vivid
      imagination of some visionary person might magnify into a hundred birds,
      but of such a case, we have no authentic knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the benefit of those of our readers who have never examined these
      birds closely, but only while in flight, we shall mention a few of the
      characters by which they are readily distinguished by the real student of
      Nature. The same description will apply to the female as to the male, as
      her resemblance in plumage is so strong as to baffle the critical eye of
      the systematist to point out any well-marked distinctions. Both birds have
      a sooty-brown dress, which, however, is not uniform. The throat, from the
      breast to the bill, is considerably lighter than the general color, the
      rump a trifle paler, while above there is a slight greenish cast. Their
      length is five and a quarter inches, wing five and one-tenth, and tail two
      and three-twentieths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of these birds are somewhat elliptical, rather less obtuse at one
      extremity than the other. Their ground is a pure, unspotted white, and in
      dimensions they vary but little. The average measurement from five
      localities is .77 by .52 inches.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he above species
      is one of the most abundant, the most widely distributed, as well as the
      best known of all our Plovers. It is a denizen of the whole of temperate
      North America, where suitable localities abound, and, unlike the most of
      its kin, breeds pretty generally in the United States. Throughout the
      Missouri region, and even as far west as Salt Lake, Utah, it has been
      observed by parties connected with the different exploring expeditions of
      the National Government. It is found in the West Indies, and in the fall
      extends its migrations into Central and South America, where it passes the
      winter. These journeys are chiefly performed at night, not quietly,
      however, but with considerable clamor. In the time of Wilson it never
      entirely deserted the United States during the season of snow and ice, but
      retired to the seashore, where it managed to eke out an existence. No
      sooner had the rivers been released from their icy fetters than their
      shrill cries would be heard as they wended their way high overhead, or
      nestled among the partially submerged meadows that lined their banks. This
      was mainly the case in the South Atlantic States, where, amid the
      rice-fields they were to be seen in February and March.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the return of mild weather our Southern friends, having their ranks
      possibly swollen by fresh accessions from sunnier climes, diffuse
      themselves over the higher latitudes. While some remain in the vicinity of
      the sea, and establish their homes in dry, sandy fields, the majority, as
      though tired of its wearisome monotone, strike for the interior, and lay
      claim to a piece of newly ploughed ground, or to some low stretch of laud,
      devoid of vegetation, and covered with shallow pools. Their arrival in the
      old haunts generally dates from the twentieth of April to about the middle
      of May, and is quite true to time in any given locality. For a short time
      subsequent thereto the sexes are concerned with the procurement of food,
      and may be observed wading knee-deep in the water of gravelly brooks and
      sandy streams for aquatic insects which contribute largely to their
      maintenance. While fond of such pursuits, the inclination to bathe within
      the limpid element to which they resort, is one which they cannot very
      well resist, for these ablutions are of frequent daily occurrence, and are
      enjoyed with great satisfaction. When disengaged from such occupations,
      they squat upon the ground, or stand erect upon both legs. If disturbed
      they seek to escape by running, or by vigorous application of the wings.
      Their alarm, on these occasions, is best shown by the peculiar cries of <i>killdeer,
      kildeer</i> which they emit. These expressions are sometimes varied to <i>te
      te de dit</i>, or simply <i>te dit</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sexes have grown weary of surfeiting, they seem to come together
      by common consent, and, without much pomp or show, enter into marital
      relations. The union thus formed is one of purest devotion, based upon
      mutual sympathy and affection. Jealous of his spouse, the male throws
      around her his aegis of protection, and stands ready to wreak vengeance
      upon any of his feathered brethren who should dare intrude upon her
      presence, or offer her the slightest insult. While thus regardful of her
      honor, he is none the less thoughtful of her comfort and wants, and seems
      ever ready to obey her slightest mandates, whether expressed by word or
      gesture. When she is ready to nestle, he accompanies her in her
      explorations, and assists in the selection of a site for a home. This
      business is seldom delayed later than the middle of May, and, although of
      immense moment, is protracted but for a brief period. The spot chosen for
      a nest is a barren field by the seaside, a piece of ploughed ground, or
      some pool-ridden, grass-lacking plain in the interior. The nest is usually
      a slight hollow, and is lined with bits of grass, straw, sea-weed,
      pebbles, or such other substances as may be convenient to the builders. In
      some cases the birds evidently go to considerable trouble, and manifest a
      taste for the beautiful. A case in point is given by Wilson. In one of his
      travels he came across a nest that was literally paved with oyster and
      clam shells, and which, in addition, was neatly surrounded by a wall of
      the same, closely and curiously arranged. These birds were doubtless
      possessed of higher mental capacities than are common to their tribe, or
      they would not have gone to so much pains to beautify and improve their
      domicile. Again, nests are often found which do not show the least vestige
      of a lining. Scarcity of materials, or absolute lack thereof, might be
      offered as an explanation of the circumstance, but we have observed such
      apparently incomplete abodes in situations where there could have been no
      difficulty in procuring the necessary articles. Such-a simple affair, as
      the nest ordinarily is, cannot certainly occupy the builders for any great
      length of time. Consequently, we find that the female is ready to commence
      laying on the day succeeding the establishment of her home. Her complement
      of eggs being but four, usually at the expiration of the fourth day, she
      is prepared to incubate. Like most birds that lay their eggs in similar
      situations, the heated sand or pebbles have much to do with the
      hatching-process. This is presumably the case in fair weather. On cloudy
      days, during stormy weather, and at nights, it is necessary that they
      should be covered. Upon the female devolves this duty, and right
      cheerfully does she assume it. The time required to hatch the eggs depends
      upon various circumstances, such as seasonal warmth, condition of weather,
      and devotion of the sitting-bird. At any rate, in about sixteen days from
      the time of the deposit of the last egg, the young birds are ready to
      appear. Their deliverance is hailed with joy. Nothing can exceed the
      attachment of the parents to their charges. Let the nest be approached by
      a person, and the birds resort to various expedients to draw him away from
      the spot, or to infuse a feeling of fear into his bosom. They beat the air
      above his head with swiftly-plying pinions, or run along the ground with
      counterfeited lameness, uttering incessantly and loudly their shrill, but
      unmistakable call-notes. These movements are kept up for a long time,
      until the enemy is led over considerable scope of country, and the young
      are safe in places of concealment. The latter are fed upon insects of
      various kinds which the birds obtain in places they visit. Besides those
      which inhabit water, grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, worms, etc., form a
      large percentage of their food. Being somewhat crepuscular in habit, not
      many of the insects which affect twilight escape their close scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are soon able to take care of themselves, but instead of
      deserting the family-circle when arrived at the age of responsibility in
      bird-life, they continue to frequent the same haunts with their parents,
      and, at the close of summer, descend with them to the seashore (thus
      constituting the small flocks which we then observe), or retire with them
      beyond our borders, to try their fortunes in brighter and more prolific
      regions. Whether they attain the adult plumage in the autumn, or in the
      following spring, it is not in our power to say; but when the birds make
      their appearance during the latter season, it is difficult to distinguish
      the young from their older brethren. By referring to the picture a strong
      similarity will be found to exist between the sexes. The rump and upper
      tail-coverts are of an orange-brown color; the tail feathers are white at
      base and tip, with a suffusion of orange-brown for a portion of their
      length, and marked with from one to three black bars. The secondary
      wing-feathers are mostly white, while the primaries have simply a white
      space. There is a black band across the forehead, and two broader ones on
      the neck and breast. The bill is black, and the feet pale grayish-blue.
      The length is about ten inches, wing six, and tail three and one-half.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are pyriform in shape, somewhat elongated, creamy-buff in ground,
      and marked with numerous speckles, blotches and scratches of a dark-brown
      color, which are larger and more generally distributed around the greater
      end, although abundant over the entire surface. The actual measurements of
      a set before us are as follows: 1.53 by 1.05, 1.50 by 1.06, 1.45 by 1.04,
      and 1.43 by 1.09 inches, giving an average size of 1.48 by 1.06 to an egg.
      The species is single-brooded.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ot to be familiar
      with this species, which country folk usually club the Crow Blackbird,
      would argue an amount of ignorance and stupidity, hardly excusable. We
      doubt whether there is a single boy, who is old enough to exercise his
      observing faculties, that has not had his attention called to these
      creatures&mdash;their strange manoeuvres and shrill cries&mdash;as they
      cast their shadows across his path, or noisily perch high-up in the trees
      that shelter his father's roof in the sweet springtime. Of course there
      are localities where these birds do not abound. But throughout the
      extended range of the species, it seems to be well known, and by some is
      nearly as severely persecuted as its very near cousin&mdash;the Common
      Crow&mdash;which it strongly resembles. It is a denizen of the eastern
      parts of North America, from the Gulf coast on the south to Labrador,
      Hudson's Bay and the Saskatchewan. On the west, the Rockies intercept its
      progress, and form an insuperable barrier. Various writers have accredited
      it to California, but the evidence rests on an insufficient basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lower counties of Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas, immense
      armies of the birds, running up into the thousands, pass the winter. From
      these quarters they take up the line of flight when the weather warrants,
      and spread themselves over the country, reaching the Middle States about
      the fifteenth of March, the New England a fortnight later, and the
      Northwest on or about the same time. So strongly are they attached to the
      old haunts that, when once arrived, they endure the greatest inconvenience
      of weather and hunger, rather than desert them. We have known them to
      appear in the midst of a violent snow-storm, although somewhat
      disconcerted however, but apparently as jolly as when fair weather
      prevails. The snow has little dread for them, but if long-standing, often
      puts them to the direst extremity so far as food is concerned. But they
      manage to live through the ordeal, some at least, and carry out their
      nature-appointed projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seldom do we observe in our Northern States very large flocks of these
      birds during the vernal migration, but loose, scattered parties of a
      hundred, or less. Upon arrival they keep aloof from wooded regions, and
      manifest a predilection for ploughed fields and meadows, where they
      destroy large quantities of worms and beetles. Few species are more hated
      by the farmer. This hatred is to be attributed to the injuries which it
      commits. When the corn has been planted, it visits the fields in great
      numbers, and makes terrible havoc with the hardly germinated grains. It
      does not stop here. The tender blades themselves, as soon as they have
      sought the light, are seized by the caitiffs, for the treasures which they
      hold concealed in the earth. The grains are detached, and the blades are
      scattered to the winds. So fond of this diet are these birds, that they
      defy the efforts of the husbandman to check their devastations. Ingenious,
      devices in the guise of scare-crows, and even the shot-gun, have no fears
      for them. Driven from one section of the field, they instantly seek
      another remote from danger, and ply their nefarious occupation with
      remarkable industry. When in ear, invested with its close-fitting wrapper
      of husks, the corn is not then safe, for the birds strip off the cover
      with the bill, and extract it from the cob. At first these attacks are
      made with great caution, but love of appetite soon triumphs-over fear and
      every other feeling, and a spirit of reckless boldness succeeds. In the
      Southern States, in the winter, they visit the corn-crib in swarms, and
      coolly peck the partially dried grains from the cobs through the
      air-openings along its sides. When denied such luxuries, they collect in
      the woods, and feed upon the mast of the beech and the fruit of the oak.
      While condemned as a nuisance and a pest to agricultural industry, on
      account of these repeated devastations, they are possessed of many good
      qualities which should commend them to public favor. For a long time after
      their arrival their fare consists entirely of grub-worms, and other
      injurious insects, which they pick up from the loosened soil, or search
      for in their hidden retreats. So persistently do they glean, that they do
      not hesitate to scratch the soil aside with their feet. What would be the
      fate of the corn if the grubworm were allowed to run riot, we do not
      presume to say. But when we come to consider the thousands of these
      creatures that are annually destroyed by the Grackles, we question whether
      the destruction and waste perpetrated by the birds would be one-half as
      great as the insidious worms would have wrought had they been permitted to
      carry on their work unchecked. Our experience has been that the benefits
      derived from these birds largely outweigh the mischief which they commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When disturbed in the midst of its pillaging, the Grackle is known to emit
      a harsh, unmusical sound, expressive of anger and vexation, which may be
      aptly likened to <i>thïc-kè-yâh</i>, slowly repeated and at rather long
      intervals. Impatience may be denoted by the dissyllable <i>të-oo</i>
      pronounced as a sharp whistle. The ordinary call-note, which may be heard
      by an individual that has lost sight of his companions, or when one bird
      wishes to call the attention of the flock to something that is then
      transpiring, is a simple <i>tchuck</i>. Among the variety of its natural
      notes, there is often heard a somewhat strange and affected sibillation,
      which Nuttall compares to that of the Starling. This sound, which
      resembles the word <i>wôttïtshee</i>, twice repeated, is often accompanied
      by a peculiar whistle. Strictly speaking, these birds may be considered as
      songless.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some instances, when we are favored with an early spring, the Grackles
      have been known to visit us during the first week of March, and to
      commence nesting about the fifteenth of the month, but then only in
      sheltered localities on the south slopes of hills. On the branches of
      coniferous trees they are then accustomed to place their nests. Usually
      but a single brood is annually raised, but when mating commences early, a
      second brood has been known to appear early in July. Nidification,
      however, ordinarily commences from the twentieth to the twenty-eighth of
      April-This is always preceded by a brief period of courtship. When the
      sexes are prepared to enter upon the new relation, the event is always
      announced by the loud and almost deafening clamor which the birds emit
      while circling in endless confusion above the roosting-tree. This usually
      occurs in the early morning, when they have shaken off the toils of sleep,
      and in the evening twilight before seeking rest. In the middle of the day
      comparative silence prevails. But when the weather is cloudy the noise and
      turmoil are kept up for nearly the entire day. They all seem to be in a
      perfect furore of excitement, and, to the inexperienced person, a crowd of
      angry and infuriated birds. This scene is enacted every day for nearly a
      week, when the tumultuous rabble, so to speak, dissolves into pairs, and
      silence reigns once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where suitable trees exist, a preference being manifested for those of the
      pine family, as many as fifty nests are often to be seen in the same
      clump. My son, Alan F. Gentry, actually took three nests from one tree,
      all within a few feet of each other, besides one nest of the Robin, and
      another of the Dove. This shows the social character of the species, as
      well as the friendship which it evinces towards others. Individual cases
      have been met with where birds have manifested selfish dispositions, as
      shown by their preference for solitary situations, and their desire to
      dwell alone. Where the birds live together in communities the utmost
      good-will everywhere abounds. The very wicked character which is
      attributed to the Grackles, has been imputed to the whole species, on
      account of the mean behavior of some of its members. Like the Common Crow,
      some of these fellows show great fondness for birds' eggs and tender
      fledglings, many of which, especially those of the Robin, are heartlessly
      destroyed. Coward-like, these villainous wretches lurk in the vicinity of
      the home they wish to pillage, until its occupants are safe out of sight,
      when they pounce upon it with great speed, seize an egg or a young bird,
      and beat a precipitate retreat. But wary and vigilant as they generally
      are, they are sometimes caught in the act, and forced to seek safety in
      flight from the impetuous attacks of the enraged owners. We have been
      aware of this fondness for eggs for many years, but the carnivorous
      propensity which is doubtless the outgrowth of the other, has been
      observed by us frequently since 1876. Where the birds dwell together in
      well-regulated societies, there is no desire to interfere with their
      neighbors of different family-connections who choose to take up their
      abodes within their territory. These assaults are always made by their
      less social brethren whose selfish propensities lead them to pass
      comparatively isolated lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the selection of a nesting-tree very little time is wasted, the birds
      mostly visiting the same neighborhood year after year where not interfered
      with. The building of a home is a labor of more moment, and generally
      requires the united efforts of both sexes for a period of six days. The
      birds are diligent mechanics, and confine their operations to certain
      hours of the day, chiefly in the cool of the morning and late in the
      afternoon. The process of building being remarkably slow, the materials
      have time to dry out in a great measure when the female is ready to lay.
      Where the materials are somewhat free from mud, which sometimes happens,
      opposition commences on the day following the completion of the structure.
      Otherwise three or four days necessarily elapse before this business is
      assumed. The eggs are laid one at a time on each consecutive day.
      Incubation immediately follows, and is the sole work of the female for
      sixteen days. The male contributes his part to the success of the
      wearisome undertaking by providing her with nourishment. At other times,
      he is in the immediate neighborhood, and warns her of danger. Should the
      nest be approached, the female glides out of it, and seeks, with the
      assistance of her partner, by loud clamors and angry gestures, to drive
      the intruder away. So venturesome do they become, that they have been seen
      to fly close to the head of an assailant, as though with fury-darting eyes
      and wide-open jaws they intended to resent the insult. Where the offender
      has been one in feathered dress, we have known several pairs to come to
      the assistance of their besieged friends, when the utmost confusion and
      excitement would prevail. Such is the bravery often displayed, in
      encounters with human foes, that victory has often crowned the efforts of
      the birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some sections of the country these birds are said to nest in low
      bushes, but we have invariably found them in tall trees, at heights
      varying from fifty to sixty feet. In the second volume of the "American
      Naturalist," a nest is described by a writer residing in Newark, N. J.,
      which was built inside the spire of a church, and also another which was
      placed in a martin-house from which the lawful owners had been expelled.
      Wilson tells us that in his day it was quite a common occurrence for these
      birds to nidificate in the interstices of the nests of the Fish Hawk, when
      the latter builds in localities which they frequent. Several pairs are
      said to occupy at the same time one of these structures, and the most
      perfect harmony to exist between them and their royal cousin. Audubon
      claims to have found nests of the Grackle in hollow trees, which has also
      been the experience of William Brewster, Esq., in Northern Maine, but it
      is highly probable that these accounts refer to the Bronzed Grackle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest is usually placed in a crotch close to the main axis of the tree
      in which it is built, sometimes on a branch at some distance therefrom,
      and is held <i>in situ</i> by others. It is a bulky affair, irregular in
      shape, and has no claims to architectural beauty. It is coarsely but
      firmly built of twigs, dry plants and other substances, interwoven with
      strong stems of grasses which have been picked up from pools of mud,
      considerable quantities of which being still adherent. This mud renders
      them exceedingly weighty, and besides serving to keep them in position,
      also tends to agglutinate the elements of composition more compactly
      together. Internally, a few fine grasses are found, which make a rather
      cosy chamber. The external diameter measures seven inches, and the height
      about six, while the cavity, which is very shallow considering the size of
      the birds, is four inches in width, and but two in depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the eggs are hatched the event is hailed with demonstrations of joy,
      and the parents watch over their helpless charges with more than ordinary
      solicitude. Such vigorous feeders are they, that both the male and the
      female are frequently compelled to be absent from the nest simultaneously
      in the procurement of food. Grubs, earthworms, caterpillars, and berries
      of various kinds, form a considerable part of their diet. It is only when
      the birds dwell in communities that both sexes are absent together. Where
      the pairs dwell singly, the one sex alternates with the other. When
      sixteen days old the young quit the nest, but are still cared for by the
      parents for an additional period of ten days, when they are forced to seek
      their own livelihood. Both young and old continue together in the old
      haunts until the close of September, or the advent of October, when the
      changes which are everywhere visible throughout the domain of Nature, warn
      them that it is time to take their departure for milder regions.
      Accordingly, the small flocks which are everywhere to be seen, gather into
      larger ones, and, as by a given signal, with many an expression of sorrow
      and regret, wend their way leisurely southward. Arriving in their
      winter-homes, these bodies do not immediately break up into smaller
      parties, but maintain themselves intact. How long they thus continue, we
      are unable to say. Wilson met with one of these vast armies on the banks
      of the Roanoke River, on the twentieth of January. When surprised it rose
      from the surrounding fields with a noise like thunder, and when settled
      down upon the road and fences, which they literally covered, gave
      everything the appearance of being invested with a mantle of black; and
      when they again rose and descended upon the skirts of high-timbered
      thickets whole trees from their summits to the lowermost branches seemed
      draped as with mourning, while their notes and screaming resounded like
      the far-off murmurings of a huge cataract, but with a more musical
      cadence. In the autumn, according to some authorities, and also at the
      approach of winter, numerous flocks, which have been foraging in the
      distance during the day, may be seen returning to their homes in the reeds
      to roost. As each detachment nears its station, in straggling, scattering
      groups, it is observed to sweep round the marsh in circling flight, until
      the note of the leader, who has been sent to reconnoitre the ground, is
      heard, when they all descend and take their stations.
    </p>

      In the drawing beautiful and accurate representations of these Grackles
      appear. The male is readily identified, and may be known by the intense
      warmth of his bronzy, purplish or violet dress. This iridescence is
      variable, and seems dependent upon age, season and other circumstances.
      The female is blackish-brown, and sometimes quite lustrous. The bill,
      tarsi and toes are pure black, and the iris sulphur-yellow. The male
      differs from his partner in size, being from twelve to thirteen inches in
      length, while the latter ranges from eleven to twelve. In dimensions of
      wing and tail there are also perceptible differences, the former averaging
      five and two-thirds inches, and the latter five and one-third in the male.
      The young is entirely of a uniform slaty-brown color, with absence of
      gloss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species are variable in number. Nests with four, five and
      six eggs have been found, but most generally the two former. The ground is
      also subject to changes, specimens being seen with a deep rusty-brown
      color, and others with one of light greenish-white. It is a rare
      occurrence to meet with the two forms in the same nest-full; the latter
      being the predominant hue. Eggs with the brown background have in addition
      to the black and dark-brown streaks and dashes which cover the other type,
      chiefly about the larger extremity, a number of confluent, cloudy blotches
      of deeper shades of the same color. These markings are singularly
      grotesque in their pattern, and often bear strong resemblances to letters,
      figures and other characters. In measurement, eggs from the same locality,
      and even from the same clutch, show considerable differences. In New
      England specimens are sometimes obtained which measure 1.30 by .88, and
      others 1.18 by .84 of an inch. Brewer gives the average size as 1.25 by
      .90. Specimens from Eastern Pennsylvania offer as much variableness. A
      clutch before us shows the following dimensions: 1.18 by .86, 1.15 by .87,
      1.15 by .87, 1.13 by .88 and 1.12 by .84. Other specimens from the same
      locality average 1.24 by .90. The Purple Grackle is quite easily tamed,
      and when confined to the cage utters its brief stock of notes with great
      freedom. It has also been taught to articulate certain words with
      considerable distinctness.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he range of the
      American Goldfinch is nearly co-extensive with the vast continent of North
      America. Its range seems to he, in a great measure, determined by the
      presence of the cottonwood, willow and the various compositaceous plants
      upon the seeds of which it largely depends for a living. From the Atlantic
      to the Pacific it is found, and northward from the Mexic borders to the
      fur countries of the British possessions. It is abundant both in Texas and
      the Indian Territory, but in the vicinity of Vera Cruz it seems to be a
      stranger, as no mention is made of it by Sumichrast. Dr. Newberry
      encountered it while passing through the inland portions of Oregon and
      California, remote from civilized life, and Dr. Cooper on the Columbia,
      and in maritime situations in close proximity to its mouth. Dr. Suckley
      was unable to find it about Puget Sound, although at infinite pains to
      discover its presence. Dr. Coues failed to meet with it in Arizona, and
      Mr. Ridgway was surprised at the notable scarcity of it in Central
      California. For the hot interior valleys of this State, as well as the
      cooler mountain ranges, it seems to affect great dislike, although it was
      observed by Ridgway to be nesting in the Uintah Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, where it is found at all, it exists in great abundance. In some
      portions of its habitat it is not a permanent resident, but migrates
      southward with the approach of cold weather, only to resume its northern
      journey again with the recurrence of another spring. In British America it
      is a late summer visitor, and departs early in September. It is a migrant
      in the northern parts of New England, and the same may be true of places
      situated in corresponding latitudes, while in the southern districts it
      remains through the entire year. In Eastern Pennsylvania, if the weather
      be not extremely severe, paired individuals, and even flocks of a
      half-dozen or more, may be met with in sheltered localities. In early
      autumn larger bodies of birds are met with, and the same is true in April,
      when there is an increased supply of food. When the ground is covered with
      snow, and the trees laden with ice and sleet, they lead very nomadic
      lives, and are often compelled to seek the habitations of man where they
      freely mingle with the Snowbirds and Sparrows, to receive their share of
      refuse from the kitchen. They now become exceedingly tame, and can be
      approached without difficulty. While partaking of our hospitalities, this
      Finch disdains not its natural food. It will lay siege to a honeysuckle,
      if in fruit, and gorge itself to satiety&mdash;a berry for which it
      manifests great fondness. The seeds of the radish, and of the various
      species of amaranths and pigweeds that grow in our midst, are also sought
      after, and devoured in vast numbers. In woods various species of
      coniferous seeds, the mast of the black beech, and the seeds of grasses
      form an important part of its diet. When the red maples are in blossom,
      dozens of these birds will settle down in the trees, and feast for hours
      upon the tender stamens and pistils, and the small insects which are
      attracted thither. As the season advances, and the apple and cherry come
      into bloom, the same fate awaits them. To the gardener they are sources of
      annoyance. They visit the garden when the soil has been broken, apparently
      for the writhing, scampering beings unearthed, but avowedly for the
      freshly-sown, delicious salad-seeds, every grain of which they pilfer,
      unless driven away by force. Later on they revel in high life, for the
      dandelion, thistles and sunflowers have perfected their fruits. Although
      chiefly a granivorous species, the Goldfinch does not subsist entirely
      upon seeds, but destroys vast numbers of insects in all their different
      stages. Various measuring-worms, diptera, ants and plant-lice are
      destroyed, which, doubtless, largely-outweigh the mischief which they
      commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in April the large flocks dissolve into smaller ones. It is a common
      thing to see two males and one female in company, the former lavishing the
      most endearing attentions upon the latter, and both, simultaneously,
      regaling her with the sweetest music. Thus affairs go on for some time,
      when, out of pure mischief, she selects one of the suitors, and just as he
      begins to feel his bosom glow with self-satisfied pride, she turns her
      back upon him, and flies to the other, who all the while has been pouring
      his soul away in the ecstasies of song. These cruel flirtations are kept
      up for a couple of days before a final choice is effected. It seems to
      require great effort and condescension upon the part of the successful
      suitor to retain his hold upon her affections; for she is likely to waver
      in the interval of time between mating and nidification, and give her
      heart to another. The labors of nest-building so completely engross her
      thoughts, that the tendency to flirtation has not time to manifest itself,
      and soon disappears altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedded couple, however, do not seem to be in much haste about nesting,
      but ramble over the country in search of food, ever and anon, as though
      seeking rest from labor, perching upon a tree-branch, where the male pours
      into the ear of his less-favored partner, with all the impassioned
      eloquence of his being, the story of his love. While thus engaged, he is
      wont to turn towards the object of his affection, as if to ascertain the
      effects of his well-chosen roundelay. A low, soft note, expressed by the
      dissyllabic word <i>twë-yah</i>, is her only response of recognition and
      approval. The song of the male is very difficult to convey in human
      language. It is loud and clear in intonation, and rivals the variously
      modulated strains of the Canary. Like the latter he has the faculty of
      lowering and raising the voice, so that one moment the notes seem borne
      from a great distance on the wings of gently-murmuring zephyrs, while the
      very next they ring out upon the air with tenfold greater volume of tone
      and intensity. In confinement he becomes exceedingly familiar and
      tractable, and with proper care soon becomes a valuable singer. A friend
      of ours once possessed a male which he reared from the nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bird was taught to keep time with the lateral movements of the index
      finger, and to increase and decrease the volume of sound with the
      elevation and depression of the same. In a state of repose a simple <i>twe</i>,
      uttered softly and slowly at measured intervals, is its only note. While
      pillaging the garden these birds give expression to sounds which Nuttall
      has likened to <i>'mày-bê, 'mây-bê</i>. In their quarrels, which commonly
      occur when small parties are on the wing, there is heard one loud,
      confused medley of discordant chirpings, which seems, as a recent writer
      once remarked, as though some were pleading for peace, while the others
      were clamorous for the fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the fifteenth of June, sometimes as early as the middle of the
      preceding month, the birds settle down to the business which has brought
      them together. Some time is spent in the selection of a suitable tree, and
      in fixing upon a position. One tree after another is visited, before one
      is found which combines the requisites of shelter, security and
      convenience. When the birds make up their minds to build in an orchard, a
      pear-tree is usually their choice. In other situations a seeming
      preference is manifested for the maple and willow. Perhaps, any tree where
      numerous small branches radiate, nearly in the same circle, from a common
      stem, will be found to be available. The height of the nest above the
      ground is usually about fifteen feet. Occasionally, greater elevations are
      taken. Sometimes a horizontal branch with divergent twigs is chosen,
      instead of one that is nearly vertical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Than the nest of the Thistle Bird, as this species is sometimes called, no
      more beautiful structure of the basket in form and the felted in texture
      is known to exist. In shape it is symmetrical, delicately and neatly
      woven, and skilfully and securely fastened to the forked twigs between
      which it is placed. In beauty of design, and elegance of finish, it is a
      perfect model of architectural skill. A structure before us from
      Philadelphia may be considered as typical. It is placed in a crotch, and
      held <i>in situ</i> by four small nearly upright branches, which are
      partially wrought into the fabric. The outside is composed of the tassels
      of the common chestnut, stems of knotweed, leaves, fragments of fungus,
      interwoven with an excess of flax-like fabrics and vegetable wool. The
      inside is lined with divers shreds of dandelion and thistle, neatly and
      compactly felted. The external diameter and height are each two and a half
      inches, and the cavity two at the rim and the same in depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nest from Union County, Pa., nearly two hundred miles distant from the
      former locality, varies materially in size and in the character of
      composing materials. When found it was placed between two horizontal twigs
      joined at right angles to another, to which it was firmly attached by
      hempen fibres. On the right of the nest further security was afforded by a
      vertical twig, to which it was bound by similar cords. Fine roots of
      grasses, spiders' webs, cotton string, twisted and untwisted yellowish
      hempen cords, nicely and evenly felted, constituted the exterior. Within
      there was a lining of yellow rootlets and white horse-hairs, the latter in
      excess. The nest is hemispherical, and measures three inches in width, and
      the same in height. The cavity is two inches in diameter and of equal
      depth. This nest was discovered about the fifteenth of August, and
      contained a brood of tender fledglings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another fabric is somewhat exceptional in position. It rests upon a
      horizontal limb, and is still further supported by three inclined twigs on
      the one side, to which it is fastened by strings and the ravellings of
      colored cottony fabrics. The exterior is made of raw cotton, animal wool,
      hempen strings, vegetable fibres, rootlets of grasses, rather ingeniously
      interwoven. Interiorly there is a strange commingling of wool and
      horsehairs. The bottom of the cavity is hardly covered, the twig which
      forms the basis of the structure being clearly discernible. in external
      diameter it measures two and a half inches, and in depth but two; the
      width and depth of the cavity are identical, being about one and
      three-fourths inches.
    </p>
    <p>
      In New England, according to Samuels, the nest of this species is built of
      soft strips of the cedar and grape-vine bark, which are elaborately woven
      into a compact structure around a deep hollow, which is softly lined with
      the down of thistles, and, occasionally, with a few feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the completion of the nest, which ordinarily requires the united
      efforts of both birds for six days to accomplish, the female, on the
      following day, begins to deposit her eggs. These to the number of five are
      laid at the rate of one a day. Incubation commences on the day subsequent
      to the last deposit, and lasts for ten days. This duty devolves
      exclusively upon the female. The only part which the male performs is the
      indirect one of providing his companion with suitable nourishment. When
      not thus engaged he cheers the tedium of her task by an agreeable ditty.
      By some writers he is considered more of a dandy than a family man, as he
      spends the greater portion of his time with his fellows in the pursuit of
      food, in the arrangement of his toilet, or in the pleasures of the bath.
      Our experience is different. While he takes no direct part in the
      incubating process, his affection for his mate, and his constant desire to
      please her, prove him to be, in every sense, a model companion. When their
      home is assailed, he does not sneak away, and allow his partner to bear
      the brunt of the battle to be waged in its defence, but comes boldly to
      the front, and with loud clamors, angry gesticulations, and wide open
      jaws, unites with her to expel the intruder. Where frequent interferences
      occur, the birds are often forced to forsake their nest, and seek other
      quarters. This perhaps will account for the fact that nests with eggs are
      sometimes found as late as the fifteenth of July, and others with young
      birds during the last week of August. Such delays are doubtless of common
      occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The destruction of a nest while incubation is progressing, most generally
      leads to the renewal of the attempt in some other place. The desire for
      offspring will often be found to triumph over the most insuperable
      difficulties. We have known instances where the same pair had been
      thwarted four times in succession, and as often renewed the attempt. An
      unfortunate male or female may sometimes be doomed to lead the life of a
      celibate, by reason of the scarcity of individuals of the opposite sex.
      Perhaps an event has occurred which has altered the status of affairs. A
      male has died, and his partner is compelled to break up house-keeping, or
      seek another. If she does the latter, her companion may be a widower, or
      one that has been unable to enter into matrimonial relations for the
      reasons already assigned. Not willing to father the responsibilities of
      another, the old home, and its once precious charges if there be any, must
      be abandoned, and another domicile constructed and peopled. The mating
      being effected, a suitable spot chosen, a home prepared, and the
      subsequent duties of oviposition and incubation successfully passed
      through, all of which requiring time, it is not remarkable that nests
      should be found so late in the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming back from this necessary digression, the young are from eleven to
      twelve days old when they leave the nest. The addition of a week or ten
      days to this period finds them sufficiently matured to attend to their own
      wants. At first they are fed by the parents upon various soft-bodied
      insects, which they glean from the branches and foliage of trees, but
      later on, butterflies and various species of andrena and halictus are
      brought to them. When able to provide for themselves, they consort with
      their parents, and subsist with them on various kinds of seeds and
      berries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young do not acquire their full plumage until the following spring.
      Their characteristic dress in the fall nearly resembles that of the adult
      female. It is reddish-olive above, and fulvous-yellow below. Across the
      coverts there are to be seen two broad bands, and broad edges of pale
      rufus to the last half of the secondaries. The female is yellowish-gray
      above, greenish-yellow below, and is devoid of the black on the forehead.
      The adult male has a bright gamboge-yellow dress, which is in a great
      measure relieved of its sameness by the black crown, wings and tail. A
      still further variegation is noticeable in the lesser wing-coverts, lower
      edges of the greater ones, ends of secondaries and tertiaries, inner
      margins of tail-feathers, upper and lower tail-coverts, and tibia, which
      are white. In the winter a yellowish-brown color replaces the yellow, the
      wings and tail become browner, and the black of the crown is lacking. The
      under parts take on an ashy-brown hue, which passes into white behind, and
      yellowish along the throat. The entire length of the mature birds is five
      and a quarter inches, while that of the wing is three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this species, when fresh, are white, with a slight roseate
      tinge. In blown specimens they show a faint bluish hue. Their nearest
      counterparts are Lawrence's Goldfinch, from which they are scarcely
      distinguishable. They are usually four in number, although five sometimes
      occur, and in shape are oval. Their dimensions vary even in the same
      nest-full. Specimens from New England vary from .68 by .53 to .63 by 50
      inches. Others from California measure .60 by 50. Pennsylvania eggs have
      an average measurement of .66 by .53. Considerable diversity of opinion
      exists as to the number of broods annually raised. Nuttall alleges that
      they raise two, but seems to base his assertion upon the fact that nests
      are found from the first of July to the middle of September, which in our
      estimation is wholly accounted for by explanations given above. The mass
      of writers, however, differ from him, and believe the species to raise but
      a single brood annually. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, we can safely say
      that not a single case has occurred to us of double-broodedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be thought strange that these birds should, as a rule, be so
      dilatory in their movements, so far as the assumption of matrimonial
      relations is concerned, being even behind the generality of our Warblers,
      which are not so well-adapted to the climate as they An explanation of the
      matter has been attempted by Dr. Brewer. He seems to think that the cause
      is attributable to the scarcity of proper aliment for the young in early
      summer. The greater abundance of insects found in July, especially in
      their larval stages, which must necessarily constitute a fair percentage
      of their diet at first, would seem to contradict such a statement. Our
      experience goes to show that more nests with young birds are found from
      the middle of June to about the tenth of July than at any subsequent
      period, just at the time when insect life riots in luxuriance.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ontemned by man,
      and characterized by the most inappropriate and disgusting nickname, with
      which almost every one who is conversant with the species must be
      familiar, our subject asks nothing at the hands of humankind, but rather
      avoids cultivated scenes, and seems to thrive best where civilization has
      neither sown nor reaped. Within the precincts of grassy pools and almost
      impenetrable morasses, where dangerous odors exhale, and myriads of slimy
      creatures drag their slow lengths along, or startle the shades of night
      with their bass murmuring? the Green Heron delights to dwell. Here he
      pursues his craft in the society of his friends and near relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in April the birds reach the Middle Atlantic States, from their
      Southern marshy homes, and soon afterwards are found in New England, and
      other portions to the westward. Their limit in this direction is somewhat
      circumscribed. The silence of writers upon the subject conduces to the
      inference that they are not found west of the Rocky Mountains, and the
      absence of mention by the parties connected with the different government
      expeditions, shows that they are not to be met with in regions which they
      visited. In the extreme southern and eastern parts of the region of the
      Missouri, however, they are to be met with. McIlwraith observed them in
      Canada West; and in the West Indies, Mexico, and from Central America to
      Venezuela, they are known to abound. They are mentioned by Gosse in his
      explorations, and Cory saw them in abundance, during the breeding-season,
      in the Bahamas. It is possible that many of these denizens of tropical
      countries migrate to the United States, and associate with their northern
      brethren that winter in our Southern States, and even pursue their journey
      to colder latitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly a month after its arrival the Heron is a solitary feeder, and
      seems to care for naught but the gratification of appetite. Knee-deep in
      some small stagnant stream or pool, or in the midst of sylvan glade or
      reedy marsh, he may be seen awaiting his prey. His movements are
      characterized by remarkable artfulness and skill. The extreme caution
      evinced by the game he seeks, and its facility to elude pursuit,
      presuppose the possession of a nicety of address, and of celerity of
      action. When on the lookout for minnows, and other small fish, he takes up
      his position by the side of the ditch, and with his long-reaching neck
      contracted over his breast, prepared for duty, he waits, in statue-like
      repose, the appearance thereof. The keen, flashing eye bespeaks the
      anxiety reigning within. He has not long to watch. Soon a luckless little
      fellow approaches the bank cautiously, when, with one stroke of the bill,
      as unerring and sudden as that of the blow of a rattlesnake, he is
      transfixed, and ere he has time to contemplate the condition of affairs,
      is swallowed entire. Worms, aquatic larvæ and small crabs are eagerly
      hunted, and captured with wonderful adroitness. It is, however, when in
      quest of frogs, that he displays the exceeding cunning of which he is
      capable. These subtle, wary creatures are difficult to surprise, and
      plunge into the water and mire on the slightest noise or alarm. A few
      moments elapse before they are sufficiently assured to venture to the
      surface again, but when they are, the movement is always performed with
      great caution and circumspection. While the frog is recovering from its
      fright, the Heron is laying his plans on the oozy flat above. Fixing his
      penetrating gaze upon the spot where his game disappeared, he steals
      slowly forward, and patiently awaits the first appearance of the bronzy
      head, at the sight of which, with almost lightning-like movement, he deals
      the unfortunate blow; the squirming, wriggling mass of matter is jerked
      from its watery bath, only to be dashed to death upon stones, and eaten at
      leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of the Heron is not the dull, prosy, slavish one which many
      writers have pictured, as it is always attended with a certain amount of
      excitement which gives spice and zest thereto. The abundance of reptilian
      and other life to be found in places which these birds visit, and the
      comparative ease with which it is seemingly obtained, render existence a
      pleasure rather than a burden. They are not the over-anxious, indigent
      race of beings which their general appearance would lead us to suspect.
      Living in the midst of plenty, although unsurrounded by green bowers and
      luscious viands, such as lure their apparently better favored brethren&mdash;the
      rich, gifted oscines&mdash;they are pleased with their lot, and doubtless
      would scorn to exchange it for others. Their lean, lank natures, as
      commonly supposed, have nothing whatever to do with the character of their
      surroundings, but are a wise and fitting illustration of the law of design
      which is everywhere to be seen in Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all our Herons, this species displays the least shyness. When
      disturbed, it mounts upward with a hollow, guttural cry, but soon alights,
      cranes its neck, and if danger is not threatening, settles back into its
      usual quiescent state. Either while walking or standing, on such
      occasions, it is noticed to jet the tail, a habit which it indulges in at
      somewhat regular periods. In addition to the ordinary scream, other notes
      are emitted, which resemble the syllables <i>'k'w, 'k'w, 'k'w</i>. These
      succeed the others so closely that they may be considered a part of the
      same call-note of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many birds usher in the dawn of the matrimonial period with music. But
      such is not the case with the present species. To be sure there may be
      heard the same cries with which it is wont to greet intruding footsteps.
      The principal indications of its return may be noticed in the preference
      which the sexes have for each other, and in their endearing behavior. They
      no longer seek to dwell apart. A week at most is thus spent, when the
      friendship formed invariably ripens into the stronger feeling of love.
      This ordinarily happens from the twentieth of April to about the tenth of
      May. Having mated, the party start off in search of a swampy woods, where,
      among the branches of some tree, they place their rude domicile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some live apart, but the rule is to dwell in companies. It is common to
      find them and the Night Heron living together on friendly terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest is entirely built of sticks, with finer ones on the inside, is
      the work of both birds, and occupies but a short time in building, usually
      not more than two days. The eggs are deposited at the rate of one a day,
      chiefly on consecutive days. Incubation commences shortly after the eggs
      are laid, and is mainly the result of the female, who, for nearly eighteen
      days, is a very assiduous sitter. While she is thus occupied the male is a
      faithful guardian and protector. He administers to her his choicest
      captures, and warns her of coming danger. When the nest is molested both
      birds hover near the tree, but beyond the reach of danger, and by the most
      deafening screams, seek to drive away the assailant, but they never
      venture upon an attack. If the nest has been despoiled, they immediately
      set to work to repair it; or, if rifled of its treasures, do not long
      bewail the loss, but proceed to replenish it. Like most of its family,
      this species places the nest high up in tall trees, although instances
      have occurred where they were not more than twenty feet from the ground.
      The young birds are carefully attended and fed by the parents, and do not
      leave the nest until they are able to fly, which is the case when they are
      from four to five weeks old. Their food consists at first of worms, larvæ
      of dragon-flies and aquatic beetles. But as they increase in age,
      fresh-water crabs, lizards, frogs, grasshoppers, etc., are brought to them
      in large numbers. They do not mature until the next season. At first they
      have the head less crested than the adult. The back is devoid of the
      characteristic long plumes, but has the same glossy greenish color. The
      neck is simply reddish-brown, while the entire under parts have the white
      somewhat variegated with dark brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of these birds are from three to four in number, oblong-oval in
      form, and of a pale light-blue color. The largest egg in a set of four
      before us measures 1.55 inches in length, and 1.19 in width; the smallest
      1.50 in length, and 1.13 in width. Throughout its entire range the species
      is single-brooded.

      Plate XLIII.&mdash;CYANOCITTA CRISTATA, (Linn.) Strickl.&mdash;Blue Jay.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his abundant,
      beautiful and familiar bird is a resident of the eastern half of North
      America, from the Atlantic west to Kansas, Eastern Nebraska and Dakota,
      and from Florida and Texas on the south to the 56th parallel of north
      latitude. Wherever met with it breeds in greater or less numbers,
      according as its presence is welcomed or rejected by the imperious lords
      of creation, and food is readily or with difficulty obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few species show more striking peculiarities of conduct, and none scarcely
      exhibit as much sagacity and intelligence. Within its natural haunts it is
      exceedingly shy and suspicious, and is hardly approachable. Frequent
      intercourse with man, however, has, in some sections, modified its
      disposition, and, as a necessary consequence, confidence has taken the
      place of distrust. This is substantiated by its tendency to nest in places
      contiguous to the dwellings of man. In Eastern Pennsylvania, a decade ago,
      it was quite a common occurrence to find a score of birds nesting in a
      square mile of territory, but, at the present time, the collector
      considers himself very fortunate if he encounters one-fifth of this number
      within the same area, and these only in localities whose solitude is
      seldom unbroken by the tread of human footsteps. In the wooded regions of
      Iowa, Mr. Allen found this species quite as trustful as the Black-capped
      Titmouse, and in Illinois, reduced to a semi-domesticated condition.
      Within the former State a pair of birds were found nidificating under the
      window of a house, in a lilac-bush, and this, too, in one of the most
      prominent and frequented streets of the town of Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious behavior marks the species' first acquaintance with human
      society. The movements of man are followed with noteworthy pertinacity,
      the slightest action being carefully scanned, but our feathered friend
      never ventures too near at first. After frequent interviews at a wary
      distance, if undisturbed, he gradually approaches nearer and nearer, and
      in time comes to regard him with kindly favor. Sometimes these advances
      are received with coldness, and the most bitter persecutions occur. When
      such is the case, the Jay takes a dislike to man, and shuns his society.
      In his rural retreats this bird is the enemy of the hunter, and often
      provokes his ire and vengeance by its tantalizing behavior. When he is in
      pursuit of game, it takes great delight in following him, and, by its
      seemingly distressing cries, seeks to warn its feathered neighbors of
      approaching danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though occasionally found within cultivated regions, yet these birds
      affect the shelter of dense forests, where they can pursue their craft
      with undismayed tranquillity. It is in such quarters that they are mostly
      to be seen in winter, searching for the eggs of insects. When there is a
      scarcity of such diet, the fruits of the oak, beech, birch and pine are
      hunted and devoured. Large numbers of beetles, some terrestrial in habits,
      also contribute largely to their sustenance. With the return of spring,
      insect life is more rife, and we find them feeding upon grasshoppers and
      caterpillars of every description. Like the Crow, the Jay is pre-eminently
      omnivorous, although preferring animal to vegetable matters. In the
      gratification of its appetite for the former, it is led to destroy the
      eggs and young of smaller birds, and even to kill those that are
      full-grown. Such merciless conduct detracts from its general good
      character, and often conduces to its destruction. But the good which it
      accomplishes, as evidenced above, outweighs in tenfold proportion the
      mischief committed, and should encourage us to desist from our
      persecutions, and accord to it a generous welcome. Its depredations upon
      the garden and farm are so trivial, that they do not warrant the abuse
      which thoughtless farmers are wont to lavish upon these feathered
      benefactors. To favor our readers with some idea of the good which has
      been accomplished in some portions of the country, we cannot do better
      than give the substance of Dr. Kirtland's estimate of its character, as
      given by Dr. Brewer. When the former gentleman first settled upon his farm
      he observed that every wild cherry and apple tree was well-nigh denuded of
      its leaves by the tent-caterpillar. The evil was so widespread that all
      efforts to counteract it seemed hopeless. At this crisis the Jays made
      their appearance and established colonies. The caterpillar constituted a
      ready diet for their young, and was preyed upon so extensively, that in a
      short time, not one was seen in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst feeding, the Jay is both silent and vigilant, save when disturbed,
      when he signifies his discontent by a harsh, petulant cry, which sounds
      like <i>djay, jay, jay</i>. In his more complaisant humor, he is by no
      means an unmusical fellow, but gives expression to a series of vocal
      sounds which for variety beauty and harmony are truely creditable, and, as
      Nutall happily notes are by no means unpleasant, and fall in harmoniously
      with the cadence of the feathered choristers around him, so as to form a
      finishing part to the general music of the grove. Wilson likens him, among
      singing-birds, to the trumpeter of the band. His notes are anything but
      monotonous. At one time he screams with all his power as if actuated by
      some terrible impulse, and, almost the next instant, greets you with notes
      as soft and pensive as those of the Bluebird, but to be only followed by
      others that fairly shock the ear with their unutterable harshness. The
      latter have been observed to resemble the syllables <i>whèèo-whèèo-wieeo</i>,
      but the sweet bell-like note almost baffles the powers of description His
      powers of mimicry, though different from those of the Mocking-bird can
      hardly excelled by that species. The cries of the Sparrow Hawk are
      imitated with great pleasure, and so accurately does he mimic the harsh
      screams of the Red-shouldered and Red-tailed Hawks, that the smaller birds
      seek their coverts in dismay, and the poultry are thrown into the greatest
      consternation. When reared from the nest these birds make interesting
      pets, and in due time learn to simulate every sound they hear not even
      excepting those of the human voice. A case is cited by Wilson of an
      individual that had been raised by a South Carolinian, which evinced
      remarkable intelligence, and which possessed nearly the loquacity of some
      of the Parrots. It could pronounce several words with remarkable
      distinctness, and when called, would respond to its name in quite a
      sociable manner. By fanciers the Jay is esteemed the most ingenious,
      artful and teachable bird with which they have met.
    </p>
    <p>
      A peculiarity of the species, deserving mention, is the habit of the sexes
      to go together during the winter, showing that some kind of attachment
      exists, even at the period when many birds, not gregarious, find it most
      to their interest to lead solitary lives. This disposition to go in pairs
      may be the beginning of a tendency to gregariousness, such as prevails
      among some of its near cousins, or it may be considered as the last
      vestige of a habit that was once predominant. Cases have been observed
      where the sexes dwelt apart, which leads to the suspicion that the species
      is surely and inevitably gravitating towards such a state. In the season
      of cold and scarcity, when most of our resident birds are too much
      concerned with the procurement of food to permit the social relations to
      have a moment's sway, the life of a celibate seems to be more fitting, and
      in very many cases is one of preference. While these birds thus continue
      to keep together, possibly through force of long-established habit, yet
      they do not manifest the slightest tendency to matrimony, until Nature has
      sufficiently recovered from torpor to insure a living for their offspring.
      Not very fastidious in appetite, and easy to please, almost any kind of
      insect diet answers. Consequently, with the early dawning of April, but
      never later than the fifteenth of the month, a change comes over them.
      Less anxiety is manifested for food-matters, and more friendly relations
      established. The sexes consort together much, and after a few days of
      courtship, which business is seemingly unmarked by any great display of
      form, settle down to the prosy realities of life. Nidification is now
      entered into with commendable zeal. For this purpose a forest or orchard
      tree is generally chosen, although a low bush is sometimes made
      subservient. In retired localities a preference is shown for the pine. The
      selection of a site never consumes much time. With old birds it requires
      careful and diligent searching for a day or two, but in the ease of
      inexperienced individuals, the time may be protracted for nearly a week.
      Where permitted to rear their progeny unmolested, a strong attachment is
      shown for the same neighborhood, and instances occur where the same pair
      dwell and breed in some cherished haunt for several years in succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the construction of a home both birds labor with the utmost diligence.
      They are usually about three days thus occupied, each bird taking an equal
      share in the task. The nest is anything but elaborate in its mechanism,
      and has little to recommend it in artistic design and beauty. It is a
      strong, coarse structure, placed upon a branch over a crotch, sometimes
      held in position by adjoining twigs, and is composed of sticks rudely and
      firmly interwoven. Inside there is usually a lining of dark fibrous roots.
      In proportions it is almost equal to the nest of the Purple Grackle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The domicile being completed, on the following day, sometimes not so soon,
      the female begins to lay, at the rate of one egg a day, her complement of
      eggs. This is usually five, although nests have been found with six, and
      others more rarely with four. Incubation is closely attendant upon
      oviposition, and generally dates from the day following the last deposit.
      This business is the sole labor of the female for about seventeen days.
      While she is thus occupied the male encourages her by his presence, or
      when not foraging, guards the spot from intrusion. He is a very jealous
      husband, and will not permit any of the feathered denizens of the woods to
      approach, without resenting it in the most determined manner, and
      inflicting severe punishment. Human interference is greeted with loud and
      angry cries, and the infuriated bird is with difficulty beaten off.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Texas, according to Dr. Lincecum, the nest is built of mud, a substance
      which is rarely utilized in more northern localities. In situations
      contiguous to houses, rags of calico, cotton thread, and other similar
      materials, form a very cosy and suitable lining. Such places are chosen on
      account of the protection against Hawks which they secure. A single brood
      is annually raised, and but four eggs constitute a setting. In the abdomen
      of a female which he dissected there were found one hundred and fifty ova,
      and from this and the preceding datum, he was led to the inference that
      the natural life of the Jay was thirty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young birds make their appearance they are welcomed with
      demonstrations of great joy by the parents. The latter manifest much
      solicitude for their safety, and attend to their demands with the most
      sedulous devotion. They watch over them with unwearying vigilance, and
      actually imperil their own lives when their helpless charges are in
      danger. Earthworms, caterpillars, moths of various kinds, beetles,
      grasshoppers, acorns, berries, etc., make a voluminous bill of fare, but
      they are always carefully chosen to suit the age and condition of life.
      Both birds are seldom absent together in search of food. When three weeks
      old, the young quit the nest, and a fortnight later, are able to gain
      their own living.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drawing we have delineated the appearances which the sexes present
      when they have attained their full dress. The female, which is shown
      considerably in the background, is duller than her lord and, in the
      natural state, is somewhat smaller. The mature male is purplish-gray
      below, with a tendency to whitening on the throat, belly and crissum. This
      is diversified by a black band across the lower throat, which is continued
      up the sides of the neck and head to a space behind the crest, and, also,
      by a black frontlet with a whitish border. The wings and tail are a rich
      blue, with bars of black. The greater wing-coverts, secondaries and tail
      feathers, the central excepted, are broadly tipped with unsullied white,
      and the tail is much rounded. The bill and feet are black, and the iris of
      the eye of a hazel color. The length is about twelve and a quarter inches,
      wing five and thirteen-twentieths, and tail five and three-quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are rounded-oval in contour, obtuse, and pretty nearly equal at
      both extremities. They are brownish-olive on the ground, in most cases,
      although some specimens show a decided olive-drab color. A few darker
      olive-brown spots, however, relieve the monotony of the background. The
      average size is about 1.16 inches in length, and .85 in width. We have
      seen some that varied from 1.04 to 1.21 in length, and in breadth from .81
      to .89 of an inch.

      Plate XLIV.&mdash;TELMATODYTES PALUSTRIS, (Wils.) Baird.&mdash;Long-billed
      Marsh Wren.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he above species
      is restricted to Eastern North America. It ranges from the Atlantic
      westward to the Missouri, and from Massachusetts to Florida. On our
      western shores, and in the Middle Provinces of the United States, a
      closely-allied form takes its place. In Maine and New Hampshire it is
      notably absent, but in Massachusetts and Vermont and thence southward
      through New England, where suitable localities exist, it is more or less
      common. Austin F. Park, of Troy, N. Y., gives it a common breeder in that
      locality, and the same may be affirmed, on the authority of Rathbun, to be
      the case in the central portions of the State. In Pennsylvania, New Jersey
      and Delaware we have found it most abundant during the nesting season.
      Throughout the Southern States some remain to breed, but the greater
      number go northward for this purpose. Ridgway states it to be an
      occasional resident, at least, in the southern counties of Illinois, but
      farther north a summer sojourner. In the vicinity of Cincinnati, according
      to Langdon, it seems to be merely a vernal migrant, but possibly spends
      its summer in the northern counties of Ohio, or in Michigan and Wisconsin.
      It cannot be denied admission to Minnesota, as is clearly proved by
      ornithologists from that section. Its occurrences have been noted in
      Kansas and Colorado by various parties, but it is likely that such
      references may be set down to the Tule Wren.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Long-bill spends the winter on our southern border and southward, and
      only takes up its migratory course when the weather has settled into the
      blandishments of spring. The grand movement commences about the first week
      of April, and it is not long before the birds have spread themselves over
      the country. They reach the Potomac about the middle of the month,
      Pennsylvania towards the close, and New England about the first of May.
      When the season is forward, individuals are often met with in the latitude
      of Philadelphia and Central New York early in April.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon its arrival it seeks inland swamps, or the brackish marshes of the
      seashore, where, amid the splatterdocks of the former, and reeds of the
      latter, it finds suitable shelter. Here day in and day out, during their
      entire stay, these birds pursue the even tenor of their lives, happy and
      contented, never caring, like many of their remoter kin, for the charmed
      circle of man. Active, energetic and buoyant with life and hope, they skip
      about the tall, rank vegetation, in every conceivable direction, in quest
      of insects. Their food consists of grasshoppers, small aquatic grubs, and
      such like, which they capture with considerable dexterity. If you should
      be unconsciously led to the favorite haunts of the species, you at once
      become aware of its presence by the lively, chattering song which emanates
      from within, and, ere long, you are repaid, if you take any special pains
      to insinuate yourself within the reeds, by a sight of the quaint, little
      creature, as he dodges, like some grotesque apparition, in and out among
      the interlacing grasses. This song, which has been compared by Wilson to a
      low crackling sound, somewhat analogous to air bubbles forcing their way
      through boggy ground, and by Audubon, to the grating noise of a rusty
      hinge, is most difficult of expression. It resembles more nearly the
      sounds of an insect than those of a bird, and is a low, harsh cry, lacking
      both harmony and force of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these birds reach their breeding-grounds early in May, and instantly
      repair to nest-building, it is safe to assume that mating had been
      celebrated in their far-off southern homes, or is a matter that is entered
      into with but little show or affectation. Frequent visits to their haunts,
      at such times when one would expect to gain information on this point,
      have always been rewarded by seeing the busy creatures at work upon their
      nest. Their early movements are so secret and mysterious, that we hardly
      know anything of their presence except when they are colonized for the
      summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The labor of building is entered into with considerable alacrity, and is
      mainly the result of the combined action of both birds, for a period of
      five or six days. The exact time is hard to estimate, and is dependent
      upon the character of the structure, position, and the industry and
      patience of the architects. When the nest is placed horizontally upon the
      ground in the midst of a clump of sedges, it is loosely constructed, and
      costs but three days of steady workmanship. But when elevated to the tops
      of tussocks, or to the branches of shrubs and trees, where more
      compactness and finish are necessary, the time is essentially protracted.
      The disposition to nest in trees and bushes, which is now a prominent
      feature of the species, looks, at first sight, as if there would be, at an
      early day, an abandonment of old sites, and the taking on of new
      relations. While the species has thus gained a great advantage in lifting
      up its nest beyond the power of the waters to do it harm, it has, by
      selecting such growths in close contiguity to marshes, shown its
      predilection for such places, by reason of the facilities which they
      afford for food-detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brewer describes the nest as being placed in low bushes, at a height of
      but a few feet from the ground. This is true in certain localities, but
      where there is a scarcity of such growths, as is the case where salt-water
      marshes abound, then the birds are compelled to resort to the sedges. In
      Atlantic County, N. J., in the summer of 1874, as many as fifty nests were
      seen and examined thus built, in less than an acre of ground. The same
      distinguished writer, in speaking of their composition, says "they are
      made externally of coarse sedges firmly interwoven, the interstices being
      cemented with clay or mud." And further, that the upper side of the
      entrance is "protected from the rain by a projecting edge." This may be
      true in certain places, but careful examinations of a score of nests from
      as many localities, remotely situated from each other, fail to show the
      existence of argillaceous or other elements, much less the trace of
      anything that might be exaggerated into a roof. Audubon describes it as
      being built among sedges, and as usually constructed in part of the sedges
      among which it is placed, a fact which we have repeatedly confirmed.
      Usually, when built along the margins of streams, or by the seashore, the
      nests are placed from two to two and a half feet high, so as to be beyond
      the reach of ordinary tides. Again, nidification commences at a time when
      there is little danger to be apprehended. But should there be an
      extraordinary rise of waters, and their home be destroyed, then like true
      Trojans, when the tide has subsided, they set zealously to work, and
      repair the damage. If irreparable, they succumb to fate, or rear their
      domicile anew. In selecting such a site for purposes of nesting, they must
      run the risk of having it submerged or demolished, but the chances against
      such a catastrophe's occurring, are numerous. These nests of ours, we are
      convinced, can withstand the beatings of a summer shower, as well as any
      whose walls are mud-cemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      While some birds excel in singing, others are differently gifted, and show
      talents as peculiar and remarkable. Such is the case with the subject of
      our sketch. Denied the power of song, he has developed his faculties in
      the direction of architecture, not the least interesting part of his
      history being his curious habit of nidification. For convenience, comfort
      and durability his nest has few equals. It is a large bulky affair, in
      shape resembling a cocoanut, and is composed of the tops of coarse reeds
      and grasses woven together. This globe-like, hollow body is secured to the
      upright stems of the growing reeds, several of which usually pass through
      its substance, and supports a little hole on the side, which looks forward
      and down into a cosy chamber, that is well lined with finer leaves of
      grasses, the dermis of weeds, and a mixture of soft feathers and wool. In
      many specimens which we have met with from time to time, the opening is
      nearly concealed by the enveloping grasses, which seem to be purposely
      arranged with this object in view. Preparatory to entering the nest, the'
      stalks are thrust aside, and are as carefully readjusted when the bird is
      once there. On retiring, the same movements are necessary. The flexibility
      of the grass aids the birds very materially in these operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      While most of the nests we have examined correspond in the main with the
      above description, we have occasionally met with some which constituted a
      noteworthy exception. These structures bear a close resemblance to those
      of the Maryland Yellow-throat in configuration, being nearly oven-shaped.
      In these cases the openings were large, about two inches in diameter, and
      occupied the anterior aspect. The materials of composition differed but
      little, on the outside, from those which are generally found in the
      typical nest, but, within, they consisted of fine grasses and silk-like
      threads of vegetable origin. This nest was placed on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most beautiful nest which we have ever seen was obtained in the summer
      of 1878, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, by Isaac Reiff, Esq. It was
      placed upon a willow branch, at the height of about fifteen feet from the
      ground, and was newly built. In shape it was nearly globular, four and a
      half by five inches in the two diameters, and was woven of the broad
      leaves of a species of scirpus, closely and evenly, and had the
      interstices seamed with brownish down. The opening was hung with a thin,
      delicate curtain of gauze, of the same material, which was continued
      within, forming a thick bedding of the softest texture, of which the most
      voluptuous sybarite might envy its fortunate possessor. In shape and
      composition the nests which are found on bushes, bear a striking
      resemblance to the one just described, but usually lack its neat and
      elegant finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of structures that may sometimes be seen in a small stretch of
      marshy ground, within a few paces of each other, is so astounding, and
      apparently so disproportionate to the size of the community inhabiting it,
      as to lead to the suspicion that more nests are constructed than are
      really needed, the idea being that the nervous, energetic males keep up
      building operations while the females are incubating, as a sort of
      pastime, or because they have nothing else to do, and must have some
      employment for their excessive animal spirits. However this may be, the
      old nests remain intact a year or so before they crumble to pieces, which
      doubtless will, in a measure, account for the large numbers that are often
      to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest having been completed, a few days are allowed for drying before
      the female essays to deposit her chocolate-colored treasures, some six to
      nine in number. A day is allowed for each egg, usually, but we have found
      nests which showed that more than one had been laid on some days, but
      these were exceptional cases. The female is the first to incubate. When
      tired of the duty, she summons her companion, who is never far away, and
      resigns the care to him, while she strays off to a short distance for food
      and recreation. At such times, the males are exceedingly pugnacious, and
      will not allow any trespassers. The females, on the contrary, are less
      demonstrative. After fourteen days of close sitting and vigilance, the
      young appear, and need the most assiduous attentions. And such they
      receive. Few parents are more devoted. From early morning until night, the
      one or the other is on the go, in quest of some juicy morsel of
      insect-food for their keen appetites. And what is their reward? In a
      fortnight, a whole nest-full of bright, rollicking and chirping children.
      Proud of their charges, they still continue to care for them a week
      longer, when they lead them one by one out of the nursery, and introduce
      them to the world. The young are now old enough to encounter the dangers
      and trials of life, while the parents not contented with having
      successfully raised one family, after a brief season of repose, depart to
      a spot close-by, where they immediately rear another domicile, which they
      people as before. This occurs late in June, or early in July.

      The eggs of this Wren are oval in shape; occasionally, spheroidal. They
      are generally marked, quite profusely, with blotches of deep
      chocolate-brown, so as to present an almost uniform appearance. Sometimes,
      a darker area is seen at the larger extremity, or around it. Again,
      specimens are met with which display a whitish ground, thickly dotted with
      chocolate, or a nearly uniform brownish-white surface, with a few of the
      characteristic blotches remaining, as if the color had been washed out.
      The average length of a set of nine before us is .65 inches, and average
      breadth .50, It is quite common to find a very large number of eggs,
      diminutive specimens, called "runt" eggs, which measure only .53 by .46.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he subject, whose
      habits we are about to introduce to our readers, has a wide range, and is
      variously distributed. It is found from Florida to Canada, and westward
      from the Atlantic to California. Audubon met with it along the Mississippi
      River, the upper branches of the Arkansas, and also in Upper Canada. Dr.
      Woodhouse found it quite common in New Mexico, Texas and the Indian
      Territory. In Nebraska it appears to be exceedingly rare, as it was only
      seen on two occasions by Ridgway in the summer of 1867. Wilson traced it
      north to Lake Ontario, from the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations. Outside of
      the United States, on the south, it has been observed by various parties:
      Newton, upon St. Croix Island; Gosse, in Jamaica; Salvin, in Central
      America; Lembeye, in Cuba; and even as far south as Buenos Ayres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respecting its eastern record of distribution, writers on ornithology are
      pretty generally agreed. West of the Rocky Mountains, its range is not so
      well made out. Early observers accredited it to Oregon, but, in recent
      times, there has not appeared any confirmation of their statements. Its
      presence, even in California, was for a long time doubted, and it was
      thought that, as the notes of the Burrowing Owl resembled those of the
      Cuckoo, many may have been deceived thereby. So close is the likeness,
      that Dr. Coues acknowledges that he would have been deluded himself, had
      he not been forewarned. According to Cooper the noise produced by the
      Spade-footed Toad exhibits marked similarity. But there is now no longer
      any hesitancy in including it in the avi-fauna of that State.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are first apprised of the coming of this species into our midst by the
      peculiar notes which it emits. These sound like the syllables <i>koo-koo-koo</i>.
      As they are probably more frequently uttered on the approach of falling
      weather than at any other time, both it and its nearest relation&mdash;the
      Black-billed Cuckoo&mdash;have received the vulgar appellation of "Rain
      Crow" for the same uncouth guttural notes are uttered, in the same
      plaintive manner, and on similar occasions, by both birds, with this
      exception, however, that the Yellow-billed is noisier, and more forcible
      in its expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      From its first advent late in April, or early in May, until it takes up
      the line of flight southward in September, this bird startles us by its
      eccentric behavior. Though remarkably shy and unsociable, it is less so
      than its congener. In Eastern Pennsylvania, it seldom inhabits high, open
      woods, for which the latter has a fondness, but manifests a strong
      preference for low hedges along the borders of fields and public roads, or
      an isolated pine or apple tree in orchard or garden. In the latter place
      it is as often seen in the lower, as in the upper, branches. Places remote
      therefrom, in other States, show a marked change in this respect. Not only
      does it betray an instinctive dread of man, by seeking the summits of the
      tallest trees in loose woods, or those of large shade-trees in our city
      parks, but it also studies how best to conceal itself from his gaze.
      Though ordinarily hidden birds, but when in search of the various winged
      insects which contribute to their sustenance, they show rather
      conspicuously. But they are oftener heard than seen. When ready to change
      their position, they maintain a long silence, and being assured that the
      coast is clear, stealthily glide from their perches, and on rapid,
      noiseless pinions, wend their flight to the coveted spot. On attaining
      which, they stand like statues for a long time, utter their famous cry,
      and when surfeited with the sights about them, renew their flight. Thus
      they keep it up until called to desist therefrom by household duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few species manifest more strongly the faculty of curiosity. When nestled
      in umbrageous security, so artfully concealed as to elude the keen gaze of
      detection, this bird is wont to eye everything with inquisitiveness and
      distrust. Peering down upon you through the dense foliage, there is
      nothing in its looks to command your pity; but you are reminded of one who
      has been guilty of wrong, and who fears the consequences. Where accustomed
      to man, a radical change seems to come over its demeanor. The eye looks
      out with a milder expression. When we remember that, like the Jays, these
      birds are abandoned thieves who pilfer the eggs of other and weaker birds,
      and even devour their helpless offspring, we are not surprised that they
      should be so sneaking in their actions, and cowardlike. But when the
      mating period arrives, one would think that the arousing of the hitherto
      dormant amatory forces into normal activity, would tend to soften their
      natures, and call into play a better state of feelings. So it does, but
      only so far as to reconcile the sexes to each other, and force them to
      forsake their selfish lives. Towards other species they still preserve the
      same unfriendly relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The male, who arrives ten days before the female, is the first to
      experience a desire for a change of life. Tired of aimless wanderings, he
      goes off in search of a companion. He is not long in finding one. A
      recital of his love, in his own peculiar fashion, soon gains a willing
      listener, and business is settled in an instant. There is none of that
      amusing frivolity which is known to mark the actions of many of our
      feathered creatures. He proposes, she accepts, and the matrimonial knot is
      tied, at least, for another season. While the sexes do not manifest any
      apparent regard for each other for two or three weeks after their first
      arrival, being chiefly absorbed in the procurement of food, yet they do
      not wholly desert each other, but feed within calling distance. From long
      observations, continued through nearly two decades, we are led to believe
      that the same birds mate annually, unless prevented by the death of one or
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the choice of a tree these birds are somewhat fastidious in some
      localities. A preference is often manifested for some species of
      evergreen, but not unfrequently are they tempted to nest in an osage
      orange, a barberry bush, a thorn, or an apple. The kind of a bush or tree
      will doubtless be found to vary with locality. While engaged in looking
      for a suitable nesting place, the male is very attentive to his partner,
      and cannot brook her absence. He watches with jealous eye her every
      movement, and follows her in all her journeyings. Though usually quite
      cowardly, he is at these times very brave, and will venture to attack any
      bird that happens near. But as his cowardice is proverbial, he rarely
      succeeds with birds of his own size, and is often compelled to retire from
      the battle discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a tree is chosen, the happy pair proceed to build their loose,
      rickety dwelling upon a forked or horizontal branch, at elevations varying
      from five to seldom more than twenty feet, according to our experience.
      The nest may be compared to a miniature Crow's. It is mainly composed of
      small sticks and some grasses, artlessly and loosely interlaced, and so
      unsubstantial, that it scarcely survives the season. The cavity is quite
      shallow. The dimensions vary somewhat with the locality, but a specimen
      before us measures seven inches in diameter, and about three in height.
      The cavity is nearly four inches wide, and less than one in depth. The
      construction of such a loose affair ordinarily requires but two days, and
      is the result of the united efforts of both birds, working with
      commendable patience and zeal, but not continuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the domicile is finished, the female, after a day spent in
      congratulating her lord upon their combined success, proceeds to furnish
      it. This business continues for many days, varying according to the number
      of eggs laid, and the irregularity in time of laying, eggs being
      frequently deposited about the time that others are hatching. Nests are
      often found with a single fresh egg in each, another partly incubated, a
      newly-hatched bird, and one or more young still further advanced. But, as
      a rule, only a single egg is daily deposited. Incubation, in the latitude
      of Philadelphia, often commences when only two eggs are deposited, but
      instances are recorded where such was the case after the first extrusion,
      the female depositing others as the process goes on. This seems like a
      strange fancy of hers, but evidently shows great forethought and
      prevision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rude house which is built for the accommodation of the eggs, being
      open and much exposed, and made of seemingly unsuitable materials, fails
      to provide the necessary protection, and thus is necessitated close and
      arduous sitting by both birds. The hatching of a few young birds at the
      time when eggs are being laid, secures the continued warmth necessary for
      development, and thus materially aids parental exertions. In many
      instances the eggs are deposited before the incubating process has
      commenced. The time required for hatching is about fourteen days.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this business is progressing, the male, when not upon the nest,
      seldom forsakes his partner, save to provide himself and her with food.
      Perched upon a small limb close-by, he seems all vigilance, and is in
      constant readiness to reply to her calls. Feelings of the most devoted
      affection are mutually exchanged. If the eggs are handled, prior to the
      assumption of incubation, the birds are apt to desert the nest; but when
      this has commenced, the female is so attached to her young that she will
      almost permit herself to be captured rather than leave them. If forced to
      vacate, we have never known her to precipitate herself upon the ground,
      and seek, by her fluttering and personation of lameness, to draw the
      intruder away, as Nuttall affirms, but have always observed her to take a
      position upon a tree in the immediate vicinity, where she would sit
      silently and demurely contemplating the purposed desecration. Mr. Newton,
      in his paper on the habits of the birds of St. Croix Island, testifies to
      the conjugal affection which is evinced by these birds. On one occasion a
      male had been killed. The female, attracted by his shriek as he fell to
      the ground, appeared upon the scene, and showed the most intense anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 1872, a nest of this species was placed upon a tree
      within full view of our window, from which the minutest details of the
      every-day life of these birds could be closely studied. Children in their
      plays would frequently pass under the tree while the birds were engaged in
      breeding, but the latter were so intent upon the work that their presence
      was unheeded. The nest was completed, eggs were deposited and hatched, and
      the young matured, the parent birds evidently feeling as secure as in more
      retired situations. On this occasion it was discovered that when the young
      were all hatched together, the duty of feeding devolved upon one or the
      other parent, both never being absent from the nest at the same time. But,
      on the other hand, where the young are hatched at irregular intervals, the
      non-incubating bird assumes the duty of providing nourishment both for his
      mate and early-hatched young, while the other is occupied with the cares
      of incubation. When the young are able to quit the nest, which they do in
      little more than a fortnight after hatching, the parents hail the event
      with great joy. Their efforts to induce them from the nest at first are
      rather amusing, and evince extreme patience and thorough good-will. But
      when the step is once taken, their odd, curious gestures betoken the
      highest pleasure and satisfaction. The young are now almost old enough to
      care for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never more than a single brood is annually raised in Pennsylvania,
      although Mr. Nuttall affirms that several are brought out, according to
      his observations. His opinion appears to have been based upon the
      discovery of eggs as late as August 28. In some localities this may be so,
      but we cannot find any record thereof. The same distinguished writer has
      recorded the finding of a Cuckoo's egg in the nest of a Catbird, and
      another as late as the fifteenth of July, in a Robin's nest. These were
      considered at first as rare, if not incredible instances, but latterly, we
      have some well-authenticated cases of such parasitism. These observations,
      coupled with others equally as important which have been recorded, tend to
      show a close relationship between our American Cuckoo and their not very
      distant European brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this bird are oblong-oval, less spherical than those of the
      Black-bill, and have an equal obtuseness at each end. They are of light
      bluish-green color, and, like those of the other, are quite apt to fade on
      exposure to light, thus rendering them difficult of distinction. The
      average measurement is 1.22 inches in length, and .94 in width, although
      specimens are occasionally found which show marked variations in size,
      some being smaller, but few exceeding these dimensions.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>robably no species
      possesses greater peculiarities of voice, manners and habits than the one
      we are about to notice. Somewhat terrestrial in life, frequenting tangled
      vines and brambles, it seemingly abhors publicity, and is best pleased
      when under concealment. When hid away in its almost inaccessible retreats
      it is hard to locate, and this difficulty is enhanced by its wonderful
      powers of ventriloquism. It is a restless being, however, delighting in
      new sights and scenes, and though its movements are well-timed and silent,
      yet it does not always escape detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its distribution throughout the United States is somewhat restricted, and
      its abundance in any given locality is uncertain. It ranges from Florida
      to Massachusetts, and as far to the west as Fort Riley and Eastern Kansas.
      Among the Rocky Mountains to the northward, it has been observed to reach
      the sources of the Arkansas. In Massachusetts, it is not uncommon, and a
      few are known to breed at Lynn, Farther northward, on the Atlantic
      seaboard, we have no mention of it. In Central New York it is a very rare
      summer visitor, and in Southern Illinois we learn that it breeds in common
      with the Maryland Yellow-throat, but diminishes in numbers to the north.
      Mexico and Guatemala claim it in their avi-fauna, but there are no records
      of its inhabiting any of the West India Islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      From their winter resorts, long after the Thrushes and Sparrows have
      reached their summer homes, these Chats, in the company of the vast army
      of Warblers of which they are a part, take up their flight late in April,
      but it is not until the first week of May that they reach Pennsylvania.
      Other portions of their limited habitat are attained at nearly the same
      time. But it is the males who first appear. For reasons, which we do not
      understand, the females are slow in making their appearance, and do not
      arrive until three days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once arrived, they keep aloof from cultivated domains, and spend their
      time in the dense underbrush of high woods, or in the clumps of briers of
      unimproved fields. Few birds manifest greater shyness. Whether this
      character can be attributed to timidity, we cannot say, but we are rather
      prone to believe it is only assumed in order to conceal their purposes and
      doings the better. When nurseries of young trees are visited, even though
      they should be situated close-by occupied dwellings, which is sometimes
      the case, we cannot perceive any difference in their conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though coming in early May, when Nature is fresh with verdure and buoyant
      with life, yet there is no desire shown for mating. The sole thought seems
      to be the acquirement of food. Its foraging is not wholly restricted to
      trees and shrubs, but the ground as well. While thus engaged, the bird is
      seen to the best advantage. There is noticeable a most remarkable agility
      combined with a certain degree of eccentricity. Squatting upon the ground,
      it keeps up a continual jerking movement of the tail, for a long time, but
      tired of this, it springs to the feet, and the most ridiculous and uncouth
      antics follow. Should it be surprised while thus employed, it seeks to
      conceal itself in the adjoining bushes, or finds security in flight.
      Beetles, ants, small spiders and moths constitute for awhile its fare, but
      these give place to caterpillars and fruits when abundant.

    <p>
      Whilst feeding, the male keeps remarkably silent, and it is only towards
      the close of the month that he essays a song. A change now comes over his
      behavior. He is more active than ever, is less tempted by the sight of
      food, and acts like one who is in search of something lost. He enters a
      copse, a cluster of brambles, in short, auy place of concealment, and
      gives himself up to the strangest diversions. The most peculiar sounds
      emanate therefrom. At one time, in loudest key, but gradually falling, and
      with forced rapidity, he treats you with music, if such we may be pleased
      to style it, that favorably compares with the whistling of the wings of a
      duck. Again, he produces, with wonderful exactness, the bark of puppies;
      and, as if to show his skill further, closes with the mew of a cat, only
      hoarser. These notes are produced with wonderful vehemence in several
      keys, and with peculiar modifications. As the voice apparently shifts from
      place to place, the possessor being unseen, it seems to be more like that
      of a spirit than of a bird. Near you one moment, the next it comes from a
      distance, so that by these tricks, it is not always possible to locate
      with any degree of certainty the astute ventriloquist. To convey in human
      characters this song exactly, is beyond the power of mortals. The
      following syllables express it with tolerable correctness: <i>twi-wi-wï-wi-wï-wi'i,
      hawawawawae, kith, chï-chï-chi-chï-chi, tweiiiii, chwëah</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such herculean efforts as the foregoing are certainly deserving of
      success. Events justify the thought. A few hours at most, and his song
      receives a response. Aroused from her absorption, his true love appears.
      The scenes now enacted are ludicrous in the extreme. He flies about her,
      utters a few syllables of affection, and at length settles down by her
      side. His whole expression is one of intense delight. While her lord is
      thus fairly beside himself with joy, she is of a passive disposition. To
      one who is not experienced in matters pertaining to bird-life, her conduct
      would seem to betoken lukewarmness. But it is only the coyness of a modest
      female. Having won his prize, the happy husband leads the way into some
      secluded spot, where he lays before her his plans for the future. She
      immediately assents to them, and soon the pair are found beating in and
      out of the bushes for a home-spot. As many as two days are often spent in
      these delightful pilgrimages. At length, one is discovered which combines
      the essentialities, and a house is erected. In woods that are seldom
      desecrated by the polluting touch of wicked man, there is manifest but
      little tendency to concealment. Not so in fields which adjoin his
      retreats. Here the greatest caution is observed, the nest being built in
      some almost impenetrable bramble-patch, and so placed as to be out of
      reach of the keenest vigilance. If discovered in such a place, it is more
      the result of chance than good management, and not through any fault of
      the birds. We have found it often within a forked twig of the common
      laurel, more frequently in brier-bushes, and not uncommonly in a young
      oak, where scores of them are growing thickly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nest is from three to four days in building, through the steady,
      persevering efforts of the architects. In texture it is rather loose, and
      is made almost exclusively of strips of bark, dry leaves and stems of
      grasses. In some instances the ribbons of bark are from one-half to
      three-fourths of an inch in width, and nearly nine inches in length. Such
      being the exterior fabric, the inner is composed of a thick lining of
      roots, rather compactly interwoven, and gradually diminishing in size
      towards the centre. There is a difference in the composing substances
      observable in nests from the most diverse localities. Some are built of
      leaves on the outside, loosely aggregated and held together by the small
      and nearly vertical branches between which they are placed. Within, there
      is a profusion of grape-vine bark, small sticks, stems of grasses, and a
      lining of beech-leaves. In external diameter the nest varies from four and
      a half to five inches, and has a height of about two and a half inches.
      The cavity is about three inches wide, and the depth one and

      Oviposition rapidly succeeds nest-building, and proceeds at the rate of
      one egg per day. This is followed by incubation, which continues for a
      period of eleven days, the female performing the whole of the labor. The
      male seldom forsakes her, save to procure food. He is the most faithful
      and jealous of husbands, carefully providing her with nourishment, and
      guarding her from harm. The approach of an enemy is heralded by loud and
      noisy chatterings between fear and anger, and even frequent attempts are
      made at repulsion. He is, however, in the height of his glory when by her
      side, and seeks by many pleasing little ways to relieve the fatigue and
      monotony of her task. His song at this time is more loud and incessant
      than ever. Braving concealment, he mounts into the air almost
      perpendicularly to the height of thirty or forty feet, with his may be
      pleased to style it, that favorably compares with the whistling of the
      wings of a duck. Again, he produces, with wonderful exactness, the bark of
      puppies; and, as if to show his skill further, closes with the mew of a
      cat, only hoarser. These notes are produced with wonderful vehemence in
      several keys, and with peculiar modifications. As the voice apparently
      shifts from place to place, the possessor being unseen, it seems to be
      more like that of a spirit than of a bird. Near you one moment, the next
      it comes from a distance, so that by these tricks, it is not always
      possible to locate with any degree of certainty the astute ventriloquist.
      To convey in human characters this song exactly, is beyond the power of
      mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such herculean efforts as the foregoing are certainly deserving of
      success. Events justify the thought. A few hours at most, and his song
      receives a response. Aroused from her absorption, his true love appears.
      The scenes now enacted are ludicrous in the extreme. He flies about her,
      utters a few syllables of affection, and at length settles down by her
      side. His whole expression is one of intense delight. While her lord is
      thus fairly beside himself with joy, she is of a passive disposition. To
      one who is not experienced in matters pertaining to bird-life, her conduct
      would seem to betoken lukewarmness. But it is only the coyness of a modest
      female. Having won his prize, the happy husband leads the way into some
      secluded spot, where he lays before her his plans for the future. She
      immediately assents to them, and soon the pair are found beating in and
      out of the bushes for a home-spot. As many as two days are often spent in
      these delightful pilgrimages. At length, one is discovered which combines
      the essentialities, and a house is erected. In woods that are seldom
      desecrated by the polluting touch of wicked man, there is manifest but
      little tendency to concealment. Not so in fields which adjoin his
      retreats. Here the greatest caution is observed, the nest being built in
      some almost impenetrable bramble-patch, and so placed as to be out of
      reach of the keenest vigilance. If discovered in such a place, it is ble
      that man's endeavors could succeed any better; perhaps, not so well. A
      full-fledged bird might accustom itself to the aviary, and become quite an
      agreeable pet, but the species has not excited sufficient interest in
      fanciers to induce them to make the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      As shown in the Plate, the Chat is bright olive-green above. Below,
      excepting the abdominal region which ends abruptly with white, the color
      is a bright golden-yellow. The lore is black, and separates the white
      under eyelid from a superciliary line of the same color above, and also a
      short maxillary one below. The wings and tail are unmarked, and glossed
      with olive, while the bill and feet are blue-black. The length varies from
      seven to seven and a half inches; the wing is about three, and the tail
      three and a quarter. From the male, the female differs in being smaller,
      and in the indistinctness of her markings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are usually four in number. Nests, however, are sometimes found
      with three as a complement, and others with as many as five, though
      rarely. In configuration they are slightly rounded-oval. The ground-color
      varies from a clear, snowy-white to one in which a slight tinge of yellow
      is perceptible, and the markings are chiefly reddish-brown, interspersed
      with a few of a faint lilac color. In some specimens which we have
      examined, the spots are pretty uniformly distributed over the
      egg-surfaces, and this seems to be the rule in the same nest-full. Others
      have them arranged more especially about the larger half, leaving the
      smaller almost barren-of them. It is in the latter that the white ground
      usually prevails. Variations also exist in size, even in the same
      locality, for we have often met with eggs that measured as much as .94 of
      an inch in length, and others but .85, and in breadth from .64 to .70.
      Throughout its entire range the species appears to be single-brooded. In
      the Middle Atlantic States this is assured beyond a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the young are hatched, he ceases these vocal performances and odd
      gestures, and unites with his mate to render homage and obeisance to the
      new comers. From early morning until sunset they are busy scouring the
      fields and woods for insects, both parents never being absent at the same
      time on this business. Larvæ of various kinds, smaller lepidoptera, and
      straw- and blackberries are in much demand, and hunted with great
      perseverance and industry. With age comes an increase in the quantity and
      quality of their food. In thirteen days from the time of hatching we find
      them ready to leave the nest, and a week later, they are old enough to
      care for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breeding season being over, both young and old spend the time until
      their departure in September, in thick brier-bushes, and within close
      hedges, occasionally, however, forsaking such places for cultivated
      grounds. Now the song of the male can be heard at midnight, and so fond
      does he seem of this sort of diversion, that he frequently continues
      singing until daybreak. The early departure of the Chat is not due to the
      paucity of appropriate food-stuffs, but chiefly to its susceptibility to
      cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      No attempts, as far as we have been able to ascertain, have ever been made
      to rear these birds from the nest. Their beauty of plumage, if they had
      nothing else to commend them, would doubtless compensate for the lack of
      sweetness in their voices. While they might signally fail in their efforts
      to charm us with rich, mellifluous notes, they could, at any rate, amuse
      us by the variety, volubility and strangeness of their utterances. A
      friend of Wilson's, an amateur in Canary birds, once placed an egg of this
      species under a Canary. In course of time the bird made its appearance,
      but died on the second day, notwithstanding the best of care and attention
      which it received, for the hen Canary was so solicitous to nourish the
      stranger, that her own eggs, which required a somewhat longer period of
      incubation, were lost in consequence. This being the case, it is not
      possible that man's endeavors could succeed any better; perhaps, not so
      well. A full-fledged bird might accustom itself to the aviary, and become
      quite an agreeable pet, but the species has not excited sufficient
      interest in fanciers to induce them to make the attempt.

      Plate XLVII.&mdash;HÆMATOPUS PALLIATUS, Temm.&mdash;American
      Oystercatcher.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>ssentially a
      marine species, the Oystercatcher is never found inland, but abounds along
      the Atlantic coast of the United States from Maine to Florida, where, in
      summer, small parties of two or three pairs may be seen together in any
      given locality, but more especially from New Jersey southward. On the
      shores of New England, according to Samuels, it is of rare occurrence
      during the breeding-season. It is, however, in the Bahamas, a group of
      islands situated but a short distance from our Floridan peninsula, and in
      the Greater Antilles, that we meet with them in great abundance,
      frequenting the beaches or small sand-bars, when exposed at low tide. Cory
      fouud them common enough on Andros Island in January, and quite
      unsuspicious; but in June, at Inagua, only a few were observed, and no
      eggs taken. But for all this the birds are known to breed in the Bahama
      Islands, as evidenced by the published observations of Dr. Bryant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appearing along our coast from the twentieth to the last of April, they
      manifest considerable timidity, and instantly take to flight when
      approached by man. Their vigilance is remarkable, and is seldom relaxed,
      not even while engaged in earnest pursuit of food. While walking along the
      shore in a dignified manner, with heads turned away, first this side and
      then that, they do not seem at all impressed with the business before
      them. But we must not delude ourselves with this idea. Like most of their
      brethren, when oppressed and persecuted by man, they have cultivated the
      habit of dividing their attention, and most admirably do they accomplish
      the difficult task. Do but watch their movements, in imagination, as the
      author unfolds to you what he has repeatedly observed. You station
      yourself upon the beach, out of gunshot reach, and await your opportunity.
      If you have been so fortunate as to select a well-known resort, and are in
      season, you may not have long to watch. But patience is sometimes
      necessary. If you have not this virtue, you must cultivate it. But we will
      suppose that you have hit upon an opportune moment,&mdash;the hour when
      the birds have returned from the bath, or from a long aerial excursion of
      pleasure, tired and hungry. Their voices are heard in the distance. Your
      attention is awakened. You look up, and dimly perceive the moving objects.
      A few seconds expire, and if you are acquainted with the species, the
      glittering white of their wings, which show conspicuously, and orange-red
      bills and feet, tell you at once they are the Oystercatchers. But keep
      perfectly still, or you might affright them. They see you&mdash;an
      apparently motionless mass of flesh and spirit&mdash;and little daunting,
      pass over your head, and settle some thirty paces away, which is just what
      you hoped for. Had you perceptibly stirred, you might have been denied the
      privilege which you now are supposed to enjoy. Do you perceive the
      stately, deliberate gait, the sideward glance, the statue-like repose? We
      know you do, and might have saved ourselves the question. But you must not
      grow impatient, but watch and wait with philosophic coolness for newer
      revelations. Convinced that nothing is to be feared from you, all heads
      are at once lowered, and the long, wedge-shaped bills thrust deep down
      into the moist, yielding sand in search of shell-fish. You repair to the
      spot, for your curiosity is on tip-toe, and find the ground thickly
      perforated with oblong holes, some two or three inches in depth. Further
      investigations will assure you that these holes are not made for any
      particular species of molluscs, but for other forms of life as well. Tired
      of the beach, these birds love to burrow in mud-bottomed inlets for the
      small crabs called fiddlers, which frequent such places. The immense
      numbers of these, together with mussels, solens, limpets, nereids and
      marine insects which they daily devour, afford them a dainty, splendid and
      luxurious living. Some writers assert that they visit the oyster beds for
      purposes of feeding, but this is probably a mistake, as they are strongly
      attached to scenes more contiguous to the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the high, dry, and level sands, just beyond the limits of the summer
      tides, usually where hundreds of drifted shells lie scattered about, they
      lay their eggs towards the close of May. Their nest is merely a slight
      depression in the sand, sometimes made by the female, oftener the result
      of some casualty of Nature. Though humble the spot, and poorly provided
      with the comforts which render most homes endearing to their feathered
      occupants, it is, nevertheless, one about which cluster many tender
      feelings. As the female depends largely upon the heat of the sun and of
      the sand to hatch her eggs, she only sitting upon them during the night,
      and when the weather is exceedingly cold and rainy, it might be inferred
      that she was lacking in care and affection. But no. Let the nest be
      approached by an enemy, and the solicitude of the parents is at once
      apparent. The male flies off with a loud scream, while his partner, less
      demonstrative, runs for a short distance before taking to flight, her
      object being to throw the intruder off his guard, and thus save the nest
      from discovery. Such attachment as is shown by these birds for their home
      and its treasures is really surprising, and is scarcely exceeded by any of
      our smaller land birds that are accustomed to dwell in the cosiest and
      most elaborate of dwellings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time arrives for the young to burst the checkered walls of their
      tiny prison houses, where, pent up for eighteen long, oppressive and weary
      days, they have been preparing themselves for an earthly career, the
      parents seem more restless, vigilant and solicitous. One or the other is
      constantly about. Their appearance is hailed with unfeigned delight. The
      mother is chiefly entrusted with their care, and, under her guidance, they
      are brought to maturity. If threatened with danger, at the sound of her
      voice they squat upon the sand, from which they are not easily
      distinguished; while the parents hover over and around the intruder,
      alighting betimes first on this side of him, and then on that, and, by the
      most distressing cries, endeavoring to arouse his sympathies. Sometimes
      they seek to lure him away by counterfeiting lameness. Their notes of
      remonstrance are a quick, loud and shrill whistle, and sound like the
      syllables <i>'wheep, 'wheep, 'wheo</i>. Somewhat similar expressions are
      made use of while at rest, as well as upon the wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about five weeks from the time of quitting the nest, the young cut
      themselves loose from the mother's guiding-strings, and fight their own
      battles with life. They do not wholly withdraw from their parents, but
      help to form the flocks we see migrating in the fall. A striking feature
      of this movement is the regularity with which it is performed. Like
      marshalled troops they hold together in lines, rise, descend and wheel
      about with wonderful precision, and effect other feats equally remarkable.
      However disturbed by the sportsman, they fill up the gaps which are
      wrought in their ranks, and pursue their course in the most perfect order.
      On the wing they move with considerable vigor and velocity. In running,
      swimming and diving they are equally expert, and by the last two methods,
      when wounded, are able to circumvent their enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their earliest stage the young are covered with down, of the color of
      sand, and have a brownish-black bar on the neck, back and rump. In their
      mature state, the head and neck are blackish, with tinge of brown or ashy,
      and the back ashy-brown. The eyelid, rump, lower parts from the breast,
      tips of greater wing-coverts, most of secondaries and basal part of tail
      feathers are white, while the rest of the tail, and the quills, are
      blackish. The legs are flesh-colored, and the bill and edges of eyelids
      red or orange. Their length runs from seventeen to eighteen inches, the
      wing being ten, tail four and a half, and bill three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs of this bird are three in number, ovoidal in shape, and are
      marked with numerous blackish-brown spots and blotches upon a creamy-drab
      background. Their dimensions vary from 2.31 to 2.13 inches in the long
      direction and from 1.63 to 1.49 in the short. But one setting is yearly
      laid. In the drawing they appear of natural size, but the birds are
      considerably reduced.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ew species, if
      any, have such a wide distribution in America as the Turkey Buzzard. It is
      found more or less abundantly to the Saskatchewan, throughout North
      America, from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, and in all portions of
      South America as far south as the Strait of Magellan. Individuals have
      been observed in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, though these birds are
      generally uncommon north of Central New Jersey. From Eastern Maine, in the
      neighborhood of Calais, to Connecticut, specimens have been occasionally
      captured. In a single instance Mr. Lawrence observed a small company of
      nine at Rockaway, Long Island. West of the Alleghanies, from Central
      America nearly to the Arctic regions, it occurs more abundantly. Without
      exception it is found in greater or less numbers in all the Middle,
      Western, Southern and Northwestern States. From Lower California to
      Washington Territory, along the Pacific, numerous parties attest to its
      common occurrence. In the West Indies, the islands of Cuba, Jamaica and
      Trinidad, the last-named in particular, include it within their faunæ. In
      Honduras and Guatemala, as well as in the Falkland Islands, off the
      eastern coast of Patagonia, they are common permanent residents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where the writer has had many
      opportunities for studying the species, these Vultures summer quite
      plentifully. From their first appearance in March, large numbers may be
      seen, high up in the air, moving in large circles, apparently exploring
      the ground below for their favorite articles of food. In rural districts
      they are more frequently observed than in the vicinity of
      densely-populated towns. The greater abundance of carrion to be met with
      in the former is doubtless the cause of this preference. However, in
      California and Oregon, according to Dr. Newberry, they are quite as common
      near towns as about the large rivers. In our Southern States they visit
      cities and large villages, and play the part of scavengers, in company
      with the Black Vulture. They are said to be so tame and unsuspicious in
      Kingston, Jamaica, that they roost upon the house-tops, or prey upon offal
      in the streets. In country places they are quite as familiar and trustful.
      This is evidenced while feeding. So intent are they upon the business
      before them, that the presence of human beings is unnoticed, and even when
      compelled to forsake their booty, sullenly repair to a short distance, but
      to resume their repast when the annoyance has ceased. The Common Crow has
      been observed to gather around the same food, and the utmost good feeling
      prevailed. A small flock will often settle down upon a dead horse, around
      which several dogs are gathered. The snapping and snarling of these
      creatures, when they approach the latter too closely, does not cause them
      to retire, but only to step a few paces aside, when, nothing daunting,
      they continue their feeding, apparently oblivious of their whereabouts and
      surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the sense of sight is rather keenly developed in these birds, yet
      that of smell is none the less so. This is an advantage, for both the
      visual and olfactory organs are called into requisition in determining the
      presence of decaying matters. As a proof that smell leads to
      food-detection, we cannot do better than cite an instance mentioned by Dr.
      Hill, and given by Dr. Brewer in the work entitled "North American Birds."
      It was a case where several of these birds were attracted to the house of
      a German emigrant who was prostrated by fever, by the strong odor escaping
      from his neglected food which had become putrid. Mr. G. C. Taylor, whilst
      a resident of Kingston, sufficiently tested their power of smell. He
      wrapped the carcass of a bird in a piece of paper, and flung the parcel
      into the summit of a densely-leaved tree, in close proximity to his
      window. A moment or two elapsed, when the keen smell of these birds
      scented something edible, but they were unable to find it, for the obvious
      reason that the object was hidden from view by the enveloping paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, their food consists of all kinds of animal matter. They are
      often accused of egg-sucking, and also of eating the young of Herons, as
      well as those of other birds. In Trinidad they are said to live on the
      most friendly terms with the poultry. As no breach of faith has been
      reported to have occurred in this instance, it is not likely that they
      would molest in any way our smaller birds, at least we are not cognizant
      of any such cases of interference, from our own observation, nor do we
      find them in the recorded experiences of our friends. They are
      worse-disposed, it seems to us, to their own kith and kin. When several
      are together, the most violent wrangles occur over their booty. Each
      strives to get the lion's share. It is rather amusing to witness their
      manouvres. A fellow has just discovered a very choice bit, which he is
      endeavoring to make away with in a somewhat hurried manner, but before he
      has accomplished the task, he is soon beset by a near companion who has
      scarcely swallowed his morsel. A conflict ensues. The latter being the
      stronger, succeeds after a while in defrauding the other of his rightful
      property. When gorged, these birds appear stupid and indisposed to
      exertion, the period of digestion being ordinarily passed in a motionless,
      listless attitude, with half-spread wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovered from their semi-stupid condition, they do not at once go to
      feeding again, but pass a long time in the healthful exercise of their
      volant appendages. Few birds are more graceful, easy and dignified while
      on the wing. On the ground they may seem awkward, but it is while soaring
      above the earth that they are seen in all their glory. When prepared for
      their lofty flights, they spring from the ground with a single bound, and,
      after a few quick flappings of the wings, move heavenward. Having attained
      a great elevation, they move through the ether in ever-widening circles,
      or sail on nearly horizontal wings, the tips above being slightly raised,
      with steady, uniform motion. These aerial diversions are never performed
      singly, but in small parties of a dozen or more, and are more common in
      early spring, and at the close of the breeding-period, than during the
      intervening time. It is also to be remarked that they are executed in
      silence, for the Turkey Buzzards, like their indigenous American
      relatives, are a mute species, the only sound of which they are capable,
      being a kind of hiss, which has not been inaptly compared to the seething
      noise emitted by plunging a hot iron in a vessel of water.

      When ready to breed they look around for a hollow tree, or some stump or
      log in a state of decay, either upon the ground, or but slightly elevated
      above it. Generally, there are no indications of a nest. In occasional
      cases a few rotten leaves are scratched into the hollow selected for the
      deposition of the eggs, the latter being laid without any previous care
      having been taken for their preservation and shelter. In Southern New
      Jersey, we have sometimes strayed upon the nest in the midst of a deep and
      almost impenetrable morass, placed within an excavated stump. Within the
      rock-caverns along the wide, shallow Susquehanna, as many as a dozen nests
      have been observed in a few hundred yards of space, often as early as the
      last week of March, when the weather was favorable, but generally not till
      the middle of April. A few individuals have been known to remain in the
      vicinity of their breeding-quarters through the entire year, when the
      winters are not extremely rigorous. At Parkersburg, near the western
      boundary of Chester County, T. H. Jackson, of West Chester, Pa., has found
      it breeding; but within Philadelphia it rarely does, if at all. In
      Delaware County, paired individuals have been observed early in April
      under rather suspicious circumstances. In Southern Ohio it is a common
      summer sojourner. Mr. Gosse, in speaking of the birds in Jamaica, says
      that they nest in depressions in the rock, and in the ledges thereof, in
      retired localities, and also upon inaccessible cliffs. On Galveston
      Island, Audubon found the birds nesting in great numbers either under
      widespread cactus branches, or underneath low bushes, in the midst of tall
      grasses in level saline marshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the vicinity of Cheraw, S. C. Dr. C. Kollock, as mentioned by Brewer,
      met with the Black and our present species as quite frequent denizens of
      the interior of swamps and dense forests, where they congregate in vast
      numbers during the entire year. These places are commonly designated
      Buzzards' roosts. Audubon once visited one of these roosts in the vicinity
      of Charleston, which covered more than two acres of ground, and which was
      completely denuded of vegetation. On the banks of many of the rivers of
      Southern Texas, Mr. Dresser found them nesting in large numbers, the
      timber along their borders constituting comfortable and secure shelter.
      Contrary to what has always been entertained, he affirms that they build
      large and bulky nests of sticks, which they place at great heights in an
      oak or cypress, close by the river-banks. Captain C. C. Abbott says that
      in the Falkland Islands the eggs are deposited in the midst of bushes
      beneath high banks, or on the summits of decayed balsam logs, during the
      early part of November, either upon the ground, or on the bare surface of
      a log. In certain localities, where the birds are not very common, paired
      individuals are frequently met with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are generally two in number, although instances are known where
      but a single one is deposited. On the Falkland Islands they are said to
      lay three occasionally. In the West Indies, especially in the Bahama
      group, the nest-complement is the same as in the United States, and there
      does not seem to be any difference in the habits of the birds that abound
      in the latter country. Specimens from New Jersey, Texas, and South
      Carolina are creamy-white in ground, and are variously marked with divers
      shades of brown, intermingled with splashes of lavender and purple, which
      are often so faint as only to be perceptible upon close inspection. Brewer
      mentions a variety from near Cheraw, S. C., that was nearly pure white,
      and which showed but a few small red and slightly purplish lines and dots
      about the larger extremity. Recently, we have met with some from Texas
      answering the same description. In dimensions these eggs vary but little,
      and have, on the average, a length of 2.78 inches, and a width of 2.00, or
      rather less.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duty of hatching falls not exclusively to either sex, but is shared by
      both. The time required to bring out the young is, under the most constant
      sitting, about twenty-two days. While occupied with family-matters the
      birds are seldom visited by strangers, and are allowed to rule in their
      own chosen realm with undisputed sway. Only the hardened collector has
      courage to enter their disgusting abodes, and rifle them of their
      treasures, a business not difficult of accomplishment, for the birds
      instantly vacate, and become silent watchers of the pillage. These birds
      do not seem to possess a particle of spirit, and are as cowardly as they
      are big. When captured they offer no active resistance, but very
      effectually warn off their aggressor, by disgorging the half-digested
      contents of their crop. When being killed they are perfectly passive and
      apathetic. Dr. Coues affirms that they will often simulate death when
      captured. On one occasion, an individual being shot, was picked up for
      dead. While being borne to his tent it was perfectly limp. Reaching his
      quarters, he carelessly threw it upon the ground, and went to work at
      something else. After a brief spell he looked around and beheld, to his
      surprise, that the bird had changed its position, and was furtively
      glaring around. On going to it, its eyes immediately closed, its body
      became relaxed, and it lay completely motionless, and apparently dead.
      After compressing its chest for several minutes, until he fancied life to
      be extinct, he dropped the bird, and repaired to supper. On returning, the
      bird had disappeared, it evidently having scrambled into the bushes as
      soon as his back was turned. This strategem is not new, and has been
      frequently observed by us, although unrecorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      What they lack in courage they more than make up in the attention which
      they bestow upon their offspring. Like their parents, the latter are
      gluttonous feeders, and must be nourished at frequent intervals during the
      entire day. Their diet at first is the half-changed matter which is forced
      by the parents in their mouths. When they have been blessed with the use
      of their eyes, which occurs during the second week of their life, they are
      able to masticate small bits of meat that are brought to them, although
      the early method is still kept up until they are ready to hunt for
      themselves. This matter, together with that of an excrementitious
      character, which is found about the nest, renders the latter exceedingly
      offensive, and is hardly endurable to persons of weak nerves. But where
      numbers breed together the foulness of the resort is indescribable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young are covered at first with a whitish down; but as they increase
      in age, soon show traces of what they are to be, but of, the precise
      period when they attain the adult plumage, we are ignorant. When they quit
      the nest they appear with the bill and naked skin of the head and neck, of
      a livid blackish hue, and the back of the head and nape with more or less
      of whitish down. Their dress is more uniformly blackish, the brownish
      borders above being less distinct, and the reflections rather green than
      violaceous. Mature birds have the bill white, the feet flesh-colored, and
      the head red. The general plumage is blackish-brown, and the quills
      ashy-gray on their lower surfaces. The skin of the head presents a
      wrinkled aspect, and is sparingly invested with bristle-like feathers, the
      plumage proper commencing in a circle on the neck The nostrils are quite
      large and open, the iris umber, and the tail rounded. In length they
      measure about two and a half feet, and have an extent of nearly six. The
      tail is one foot long, and the wings two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding their filthy habits, which render them obnoxious in the
      eyes of many persons, their harmless, peaceable natures should command for
      them respect from the lords of creation, even though they should not
      possess other claims to popular consideration. Like their nearest
      relations the plundering Buteos and Falcons&mdash;they offer no harm to
      their smaller brethren, nor detriment to the husbandman's stock of
      poultry. They are essentially a useful bird, and in the Southern States
      where their services are most in demand, both they and the Black Vulture
      are protected by law, a fine being imposed upon any who should wilfully
      destroy their lives. But in more northern sections they are persecuted
      with impunity. Hence their avoidance of the residence of man. As
      scavengers we recognize in them great benefactors, and when left in
      undisturbed possession of their freedom, they come in and go out among
      their human brethren, and seldom show the repulsive side of their
      character. In not endowing these birds with the same great force of
      character which she has lavished upon the Falcons, Nature has provided
      them with a means of defence, which is as serviceable to them as the
      powerful talons and bill of their courageous brethren.
    </p>

      Respecting the resident range of this species, as compared with its summer
      dispersions, it has not been observed to winter on the Atlantic seaboard
      beyond New Jersey, and is even more abundant here in summer than in the
      cold season. In Washington, where the bird is said to be quite common, no
      important diminution of its numbers has been noticed during several
      successive winters. In both the Carolinas the same condition of affairs is
      found to exist. Its winter range in the interior seems to be higher up,
      perhaps as far north as Minnesota, for it has been observed here late in
      October, and again in December, but the latter may have been an accidental
      occurrence. According to Dr. Coues, the isothermal line corresponding, on
      the Atlantic coast, with the fortieth parallel of latitude, may
      approximately indicate its farthest northern limit in the winter.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he habitat of this
      species is nearly co-extensive with the whole of North America. Throughout
      considerable portions of the United States it is chiefly migratory, being
      seen only in the spring and fall. In the Missouri region it is the most
      common of the three species that inhabit this country, and is said by
      writers to breed in Northern Dakota, and also on the Upper Missouri and
      Milk rivers. It was found along the banks of the Yellowstone by the party
      under Lieutenant Warren, and by later expeditions, on the Green River. In
      New England, according to Samuels, it is less plentiful than any of the
      other Sheldrakes during the autumn, winter and early spring, but more
      recent writers&mdash;Messrs. Rich and Deane&mdash;have found it a not
      uncommon breeder in hollow stumps on Lake Umbagog. In Central New York,
      Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey it is quite often seen <i>in transitu</i>,
      and in some localities a few are known to winter. But the majority, after
      spending the summer in the northern parts of the United States and the
      British possessions to their utmost limits, only quit these haunts when
      the streams have become frozen, for the creeks and rivers of our Southern
      States, and the still warmer climes of Mexico and Cuba. E. W. Nelson says
      they are common winter residents upon Lake Michigan, and breed sparingly
      throughout the State of Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though mainly an inland species, having a fondness for ponds, lakes and
      fresh-water streams, yet it does not confine its visits exclusively to
      such resorts, but forsakes them during very cold weather for the seashore,
      where it can pursue its calling untrammeled by the accidents of winter,
      which are more certain to affect fresh than salt waters. By the sporting
      fraternity it is now called the "Hairy Head," an appellation which it
      fitly deserves, for the high, beautifully-rounded and particolored crest
      which so gracefully adorns the head, is rendered more conspicuous in the
      absence of the usual decorations which Flora had so recently lavished upon
      the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most Sheldrakes, in common with the Ducks and Geese, this species
      depends upon the water for the principal portion of its food.
      Consequently, it spends considerable time in swimming, and being endowed
      with keen sight, is able to discern its prey at some distance below.' With
      the possession of this wonderful faculty, it unites great skill and nicety
      of address. Its movements upon the glassy liquid surface are performed
      with silence and gracefulness, so as not to produce undue alarm to the
      finny tribes and creeping things that dart hither and thither, or crawl
      their slimy lengths along the oozy or pebbly bottom; and the stroke of the
      head, when one has crossed its line of vision, is as rapid and unerring as
      the swift motion of the Heron when he deals the death-giving blow to some
      luckless reptile that has just emerged from its quiet retreats. In the
      case of the Sheldrake, it is not merely the head and neck that are
      immersed, but often the entire body receives the watery bath, especially
      when the game is out of ordinary reach. These baths are enjoyed; for no
      sooner has the bird arisen with its feathers glistening in the sunlight
      like gem-bedecked armor, than, with one slight ruffle, the jewels are
      dashed to pieces, and it is ready again. Fish, small crabs, molluscs,
      seaworms, reptiles, and such like creatures as dwell in water, are eagerly
      hunted and eaten. On the dry laud, beetles, grasshoppers and lepidoptera
      contribute their share to its varied and voluminous <i>menu</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the spell of winter has been broken, and thousands of small birds are
      wending their way northward in April, the Sheldrakes catching the
      contagion of migration, leave their winter haunts, and following the great
      arteries of our continent, slowly journey northward. After a little they
      bid adieu to these essential guides, and betake themselves inland, where
      by the grassy margins of lakes, ponds and small streams, in retired and
      unfrequented localities, in the declining days of May, or dawn of laughing
      June, they select their partners, and enter upon the duties of
      housekeeping. Around the bayous of the Ohio, on our Northwestern Lakes, by
      the borders of Hudson's Bay, and on the River St. Peters, they delighted
      to raise their numerous families in the happy days of Audubon, and there
      they still find suitable quarters, almost undisturbed by man and his
      minions. In our own beloved country they breed less abundantly, and only,
      as far as can be ascertained, in the regions, noted above, adjacent to
      British America.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the holes of tall dead trees, or on the tops of stubs, twenty, thirty
      and forty feet from the ground, seldom higher, the female places her nest,
      giving it a warm and cosy lining of soft grasses and feathers. She has
      everything her own way, the male seemingly manifesting little or no
      interest. Here she deposits her treasures, and relieved of her mate, who
      dwells by himself in some remote and secluded locality, instantly repairs
      to its precincts, and for nearly three weeks remains a very assiduous and
      persevering sitter. Like the Wood Duck, when about to leave the nest for
      food, she is careful to cover her eggs with some of the materials of the
      nest, to prevent them from becoming cold. Though not often constrained to
      leave them, but when she does, she is apt to remain away for a
      considerable time, but not long enough to endanger the developing life
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs are thick-shelled, somewhat spherical, more so than any other
      species of Duck, and a trifle more pointed at one extremity than the
      other. They are of a clean-white color, but in some instances are made to
      appear somewhat yellowish on the surface, which is to be attributed to
      stains produced by moisture from the feet of the sitting-bird. From the
      other Sheldrakes they may be readily distinguished by color and size, but
      should these fail, which is not likely to prove the case, their identity
      may be recognized by a peculiar noise which is made when two of these eggs
      are struck together, the sound produced resembling nearly that of a couple
      of ivory balls when submitted to the same treatment. In size there is
      considerable variation, but in no instance will the eggs be found to rival
      the others in dimensions. The average length is 2.13 inches, and average
      breadth 1.72. Samuels mentions specimens that were 2.30 by 1.75, and
      others, more rounded, that measured 2.10 in transverse diameter, and 1.80
      in the other direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though jealous of her treasures, yet the female is not known to risk her
      life to save them. If the nest is approached, she maintains the utmost
      silence, and only ventures out when terrified by heavy blows on the trunk
      of the tree which contains her nest. Driven out, she seeks the pond or
      stream close-by, and from its bosom surveys the actions of the intruder,
      with not so much as a cry of remonstrance. If the latter is hidden from
      view by the dense vegetation, she quits the water, circles over and about
      Him, and is always careful to keep out of reach of harm. Her quiet
      demeanor and intense watchfulness betoken the distress and anxiety that
      reign within, and, to a person of the least particle of sympathy, are
      enough to cause him to give up his desire for pillage, forsake the scene,
      and leave that mute witness of his contemplated wrong in peaceful
      possession of her property.
    </p>
    <p>
      In course of time the young are hatched. Maternal joy is now at its
      height. However, the parent does not permit herself to be so completely
      carried away thereby, as to lose sight of their interests, but sets to
      work to remove them from their closely-cooped quarters. If their home is
      some distance from the water, she carries them one by one in her mouth,
      and lays them down by its banks. In changing from one stream to another,
      where some space intervenes, this is her ordinary method of transportation
      in their early ages. Almost as soon as the chicks have been placed in
      sight of the water, they require no coaxing to induce them to enter, but
      impelled by feelings of instinct, they plunge into its depths, and act as
      though they had been there before. While disporting themselves in the
      aqueous fluid, the mother exercises a strict surveillance, to prevent
      being surprised. If taken unawares, she utters a chattering, guttural cry.
      The whole brood dive and swim off under water to the shore, and conceal
      themselves in the dense herbage. While the young are disappearing, the
      mother counterfeits lameness, and by every conceivable stratagem known to
      her, endeavors to lead the intruder away from the spot. Succeeding in
      this, she takes to wing and flies off. If apprised of the approach in
      season, before the person has advanced within gun-shot distance, she swims
      away with great rapidity, her brood following after, until they have
      reached a bend in the stream. Here, out of sight of the pursuing party,
      they make for the shore, creep silently out of the water, and hide
      themselves until the object of their dread has disappeared. The female
      Wood Duck often encroaches upon the domains of this bird, and the most
      unhappy consequences follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young are able to provide for themselves, the male emerges from
      his solitude, and consorts with his family. Both old and young hold
      together during the remainder of the season, and then unite with other
      small flocks to constitute the larger ones which are seen in migration in
      the month of October. Young birds, when about two-thirds grown, are in
      great demand for the table, as they are excellent eating. From their habit
      of flapping the wings on the water, when endeavoring to escape pursuit,
      they have been called "Flappers." It is probable that they do not attain
      their full plumage until the next spring. Nuttall says the upper plumage
      is browner than in the adult, and the white speculum and bands on the
      tertiaries less perfect. The black and white bars on the shoulders, and
      the white stripe behind the eye, are wanting. On the head, neck, and upper
      portions of the breast, a soiled pale-brown color prevails, which is edged
      with whitish on the last. The chin is inclined to white. The bill is black
      above, and orange below, and the crest but slightly developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adult male is black above, with two crescent-shaped spots before the
      wings, and a bar across the speculum, of the same color. The sides are
      chestnut, and striped with black, while the lower parts, speculum, bands
      on tertiaries, and crest-centre, are white. The nostrils are sub-basal,
      and the bill nearly or quite black. His length is from eighteen to
      nineteen inches, and wing about eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her lord the female differs somewhat in size, being smaller, and in a
      most marked degree in plumage. The two are easily distinguished. The
      compact, erect, semi-circular and side-compressed crest is smaller and
      less rounded; the head and neck are brown; back and sides dark brown, with
      paler edges to the feathers, and white on wings of less extent. The lower
      mandible is reddish at base. Upon comparison with the above description of
      the immature bird, it will be observed that a striking resemblance obtains
      between the two. Where the sexes materially differ in plumage, the rule
      seems to be that the young males take on the characteristic dress of the
      mother before assuming that which is to distinguish them later in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disposition of the Sheldrakes to nest in obscure situations, remote
      from the haunts of man, and often difficult of access, perhaps, has much
      to do with the ignorance that enshrouds their history. Were they better
      known, and more easily approached, they might be subdued by the skill of
      man, and be made to associate with the Mallard, whose ancestors still live
      in a feral state. A little patience is all that is necessary to carry the
      project to completion, if it should be attempted, and reasoning from the
      success of the plan in the case of the Wood Duck&mdash;a species
      remarkably similar in general habits&mdash;we entertain no doubt as to its
      practicability. But would the plan be feasible? This is a question that we
      are not prepared to answer. At any rate, it is worthy of an effort. If the
      trial has ever been made, we are not aware of it, nor can we find anything
      in the literature of ornithology to warrant us in saying that it has.
      Beautiful in plumage, and noted for their grace, skill and ease upon the
      watery element, they might become interesting denizens of man's
      surroundings, even though they should never, by their usefulness, fully
      repay him for the care and expense which he would necessarily be compelled
      to bestow upon them.

      Chino. It is said to occur in mountainous regions throughout the southern
      portions of California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas, and
      probably in parts of Colorado and Utah. In Southern California, according
      to B, W. Evermann, of Bloomington, Ind., who has devoted considerable time
      to the study of its habits, it is quite locally distributed, and is rather
      a common summer resident in the smaller valleys and canyons, but is rarely
      observed "in the larger valleys or more open level country." Among the
      foot-hills in the vicinity of Frezno Flats, he encountered considerable
      numbers on the evergreen oaks, in July, 1880, but only a single pair at
      the entrance of the Yosemite Valley, and these were perched high-up in a
      tall sugar-pine, not silent, however, but calling to each other in their
      own peculiar fashion.

      Our friend's first acquaintance with this species was made in the
      delightful valley of Santa Clara in October, 1879, while collecting
      Gambel's Sparrows. Intent upon the business before him, he was pursuing
      his way along a fence, when a strange bird, light and graceful upon the
      wing, was seen nervously moving from one point to another, ever and anon
      darting at some passing insect, and uttering in the intervals of feeding
      the oddest and most querulous note he had ever heard. This note, says our
      informant, was "full of sadness, desolation and despair." Never before had
      he been so affected by song of bird as by this. Since then several
      opportunities have been afforded him, and many an hour has been spent in
      listening to its song.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lovely month of May, of the year that has just passed, while
      watching two pairs engaged in nesting, he was treated to a delightful and
      gratuitous serenade, late in the evening, when most birds had retired to
      their perches. Ceased from their labors, they had taken their stations
      upon the topmost boughs of the live oaks which supported their nests, when
      one of the males instantly tuned his pipe, and gave expression to the
      sweetest yet saddest of refrains, which was "low, slow, sad and
      indescribably delicious and fascinating." Mr. Evermann, in speaking of it,
      says: "I could think of nothing with which to compare it, but at times I
      thought I could detect a slight resemblance to the lowest, most subdued
      notes of the Sickle-billed Thrasher." The song is certainly wonderful and
      unique, and should entitle its author to a very exalted position among
      singing-birds. From all accounts it is most generally heard at nightfall,
      and only occasionally in the early part of the afternoon. Of the few
      writers who have treated of this species, Doctors Coues and Cooper seem to
      be the only persons, besides the one we have just referred to, who are
      willing to credit it with musical ability.

      From their winter-home in Lower Arizona and Mexico these birds reach
      Southern California from the fifteenth to the twentieth of April&mdash;males
      and females together. At first they are somewhat gregarious, not from
      feelings of sociability, if we are rightly informed, but from the presence
      of favorite articles of food which abound in certain places. Though
      insects constitute a very considerable portion of their diet, yet like
      their supposed nearest affinity&mdash;the Cedar-bird&mdash;they are fond
      of the various berries that are to be found in their accustomed haunts.
      The fruit of the mistletoe is said to give them abundance of nutritious
      food during their entire stay. Henshaw says: "Large numbers of this
      species were found, on several occasions, in the canyon back of Camp
      Apache, Arizona. As they were noticed nowhere else in this vicinity, I
      judged that the abundance of mistletoe berries here served as an
      attraction. These they were greedily feeding upon." The same author found
      immense numbers gathered together in the canyon at Camp Bowie, Ariz.,
      feeding upon a species of wild plum and also of grape, fruits of which
      they were particularly fond. Their predilection for the berries of the
      mistletoe is attested to by other writers no less eminent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though close and vigorous feeders, yet they do not carry their greed to
      the extent that the Cedar-bird does, which, as we have seen, never seems
      to be in any very great hurry to enter upon the duties of nidification.
      The cares of the household early engross their attention. The flocks break
      up into pairs, and the latter soon start off in quest of suitable nesting
      places. The tree selected in Southern California appears to be the live
      oak exclusively, but in other localities, the mezquite sometimes shares
      with it the honor. Of seven nests examined by Evermann, four were saddled
      on a horizontal limb from four to twenty-five feet above the ground, and
      near the end; one was placed upon three small twigs, another upon two, and
      the last in a forked branch, thirty feet high, and in the extreme summit.
      In the work of building there seems to be no division of labor, and each
      bird appears to act independently of the other. The utmost caution is
      taken to prevent discovery. When a suitable twig, or other substance has
      been found by either, it is not carried directly to the nest, but the
      finder first flies to a neighboring bush or tree, where he alights for a
      brief spell, and shows his anxiety by a nervous twitching of the tail.
      Uttering a call, he spreads his wings for flight, and glides swiftly to
      another tree, and perhaps to another, each time approaching nearer and
      nearer to the nesting-tree, the bright white spot upon the wing gleaming
      in the sunlight in vivid contrast with the black body-color. If aware of
      your presence, he seemingly endeavors to delude you, for just when you
      think you are sure of his location, if you have not already discovered it
      by observation, he disappoints you by flying to a more distant tree, where
      he ceases his notes, rests awhile, but only to resume his hitherto
      circuitous flight directly to the wished-for spot. While working upon the
      nest the most perfect silence is maintained, and the builder always leaves
      in the direction opposite to that by which he entered. The routine was so
      closely followed by Evermann, that he could generally guess with tolerable
      accuracy what movements were in contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are told that from five to eight days are required for the completion
      of the domicile, and that laying commences on the day succeeding this
      event, one egg being laid daily until the full nest-complement is reached.
      By the fifteenth of May the birds are ready for incubation, although in
      some cases this business is entered into by the fourth, and occasionally
      not until the nineteenth of the month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respecting the number of eggs laid, Mr. Evermann finds that three is. the
      usual number, although up to the time of his observations, it was the
      opinion of ornithologists that the birds deposited but two. Seven nests
      were secured by this collector, in the vicinity of Santa Paula, Cal., and
      all excepting one were found to contain three eggs, and this had but two.
      Dr. Cooper gives but two as the ordinary complement, and he is the first
      individual who called attention to the nest of the species. This structure
      was found near Fort Mojave, on the Colorado, 011 the twenty-fifth of
      April, and was placed in a mezquite branch at a height of twelve feet from
      the ground. No further particulars were given of this find, until Dr.
      Brewer described it in the first volume of the "History of North American
      Birds." Substantially, he says the nest was a very flat affair, four
      inches in external diameter, not two in height, and with a depth of cavity
      of less than an inch. It was composed almost wholly of flax-like fibres,
      fine grasses, plant-stems, and stalks of larger size, variously
      interwoven, and lined with a soft downy material of vegetable character.
    </p>
    <p>
      This notice of Dr. Cooper's nest, though probably authentic, is thought by
      Coues not free from suspicion. The material of Captain Bendire, which
      maybe found described in the Proceedings of the Natural History Society of
      Boston, though ascribed by Brewer to Townsend's Flycatcher, unquestionably
      belongs to the Black-crested, for the nest and eggs of the former are too
      well known, through the exertions of Mr. Wilbur F. Lamb, of Holyoke,
      Mass., whose interesting narrative appears in the Bulletin of the Kuttall
      Ornithological Club, for 1877, to lead any intelligent naturalist to refer
      it thereto. Recurring to the subject, in the Appendix to the above
      "History," Brewer re-describes the Bendire material, although in very
      unsatisfactory terms. He says the nest was found saddled, most generally,
      on a horizontal branch of a mezquite tree, and is a shallow, nearly flat
      structure, measuring four inches across, and having a cavity two and a
      half inches in diameter, and one-half an inch in depth. Fine sticks and
      fibres of plants make up the external bulk, and within a little down of
      the cottonwood and a stray feather. The first nest, which was found May
      16, was mainly lined with the shells of empty cocoons. Though the captain
      met with more than a dozen nests with eggs and young, yet, astonishing to
      say, he never found more than two in a nest&mdash;a striking contrast to
      Evermann's observations. In attempting to reconcile the difference he
      honestly says: "The thing is perhaps accounted for, and I am very positive
      about my views being correct, that in California they [the Black-crested
      Flycatchers] raise only one brood, while in Arizona they raise two and
      three." There is no doubt of the correctness of his opinion, for in this,
      as in many other species, the number of eggs in a set is probably larger
      in the northern parts of the breeding-range than in the southern, the
      difference being made up by the greater number of broods annually raised
      in the latter.

    <p>
      There seems to be considerable uniformity in the character of the
      materials utilized in nesting. Before us are six nests from Southern
      California, and, on close examination, each seems to be the exact
      counterpart of every other. Fine grass, small sticks, thin hairy stems,
      vegetable fibres and wool, empty cocoons and seed vessels, the latter
      attached to their stalks, curiously and ingeniously matted together, and
      presenting a rather even surface, considering the abundance of sticks
      utilized, make up nearly the entire structure. The cavity exhibits the
      same materials, but then they are more smoothly adjusted by the builders.
      None of the nests before us are perfectly round, such as we sometimes see
      in the Wood Pewee's lichen-clad home, but are somewhat eccentric in
      contour. The same irregularity is usually a conspicuous feature of the
      inside. In external diameter they are nearly four inches, and in length
      vary from one and a half to two, one side being sometimes a half inch
      thicker than the other, not an accidental occurrence, but probably the
      result of design, due, no doubt, to the position of the nest upon the
      branch, the thicker part looking outwardly where exposure is the greater.
      The depression is two and a half inches wide, and the depth usually but a
      half, but varying from that to as much as an inch. In the Plate it is
      represented natural in size, and saddled upon a horizontal branch of the
      live oak, a short distance in advance of the builders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eggs, two or three in number, are of an oblong oval shape, and vary
      from a greenish-white to a lavender and a grayish-white groundcolor, and
      are rather strongly marked with small, distinct spots of divers shades of
      brown, interspersed with fine dottings of slate, which are pretty
      uniformly diffused over the surface, although most abundant about the
      larger extremity. The distribution of these spots presents some marked
      variations, but, according to our experience, a uniformity prevails in
      eggs of the same clutch. A set of three before us shows the following
      measurements: .94 by .69, .94 by .68 and .93 by .68. Incubation begins
      immediately after the eggs are laid, according to Mr. Evermann, and is the
      exclusive duty of the female for about fourteen days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young male partakes of the coloration of both parents, but the adult
      is a uniform lustrous black, the monotony of which is in a measure
      relieved by large white patches upon the wings, most of the inner web of
      each primary feather, excepting the first, showing this latter color. The
      female is brown, the white on the wings being much restricted, or
      obsolete. Their entire length is about seven and a half inches, wing three
      and three-fifths, and tail four and a quarter.
